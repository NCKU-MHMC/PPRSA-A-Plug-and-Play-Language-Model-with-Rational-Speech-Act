"Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.	What happened?"
"No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.	That's really a scary experience! Did they have any cameras? How much money did you end up with for your accident repairs/"
"I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.	Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places	Sure, I went to a public toilet on vacation, but the thing that bugs me the most is the toilet paper not fitting inside the dumpster."
"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?	I was shaken up but otherwise fine. Yes, the guy I was riding was very drunk."
"I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together	I'm so sorry to hear this, are you okay?"
"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world	That's unfortunate, but maybe there is a light at the end of tunnel somewhere for you."
"I couldn't wait to go to the concert.	What concert?"
"The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!	That's awesome! Were tickets for the whole band or just the two singers?"
"I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors	that sucks, how was she dying? was she sleep"
"she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying	that's terrible, i hate to hear that. i'm really sorry that this happened to your baby"
"yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors	so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up	Oh no! Is he alright though?"
"i was singing nursery songs :)	I hope it wasn't serious!"
"If you happy and you know it :)	my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon	That really stinks. I am sorry to hear that. Is it a really big job?"
"thank you so much!	What kind of work do you both do"
"he is an armed guard	i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods!	Oh no, that sounds terrifying."
"I do! I want to be able to protect my son	Oh no! Did they get into trouble?"
"i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years	That's cool. Are you flying or driving?"
"I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry	That's awesome, I bet your are going to miss them!"
"I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident	What a jerk. Why July 4th? Did he do something wrong on that day, or did the 4th just spring to mind?"
"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	that sounds horrible! I would have cried!"
"Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.	So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer	What a rip off. What are going to do with all the money?"
"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!	Yeah i would have been bummed out too. Did you walk into any electronics stores?"
"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed	My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	That is good of you to show him you are loyal to him.  Does he know you did it for the good reasons?"
"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	She may have done it to protect herself."
"my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house	Aww I'm sorry to hear that!"
"i totally agree with you!	Awww! Babies need company and a break from all of this crazy baby noise. It's like they don't know how to sleep."
"hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country	Why do you say that? Are you not happy there also?"
"i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	Have you thought about doing it locally?"
"I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.	That's a jerk move on his part. I'm glad someone can put a damper on his behavior."
"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!	That is really not cool.  Did he get in trouble with anyone?"
"I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died	Yeah I hate bugs too!"
"Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy	I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.	That's good. It's good to have people you know from your past relationships.  Do you see them again?"
"Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	I'm sorry that happened. But everyone makes mistakes."
"Thank you! That means a lot.	One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	Cherish that moment forever!"
"Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	Love and complications overcome time I guess, for those born with a good mom and dad."
"Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	Of course! Life's not fair! You get screwed if someone steps in too debt and it seems like they always come out of no where and the bill comes in just a few days!"
"Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.	I've certainly felt that. I'm glad you felt that way and I know it's definitely an overwhelming situation!"
"Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	What happened that happened?"
"My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	That's so sad. How did they lose them in fire?"
"Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	That's so wise! It's so easy to miss intuition when you're trying so hard."
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	That's great advice!"
"I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	That's awesome! You have to appreciate your friends even if they don't like you at the time!"
"I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there	That's so sweet! I love that feeling when your loved ones are being kind and thoughtful!"
"I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends in your area to turn to?"
"Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	I am sorry you feel lonely!  Maybe if you just keep putting yourself out there it'll start to make more girls interested maybe?  You could also meet new friends?"
"As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	That is a good point! They could very well be showing signs of early development!"
"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	Hahaha, that's so cute! It is so easy to miss little moments like that when you're just learning. It's like you see it all and now it makes you want to learn and become better"
"The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	Oh my gosh! I've never had that! Was it any good?"
"Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	That is crazy. I think they should do something about it."
"I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	Oh, that sounds so sweet, I love seeing animals suffer and have their lives cut tragically short! How long did you go with them for?"
"Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	That is so amazing and I wish I could see an orphanage teach kids."
"My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	That's good to hear. I'm not married and still get upset about my partner not being happy with me haha."
"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	I have no idea. I don't get it. Does she live with yall, or does she live on her own? I'm not sure what would drive her to want to distance themselves from each other so soon-"
"But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	What did you do"
"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	What did she do? Did she say anything to you?"
"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.	Oh my, sorry for the heart squeeze! I can't believe she is gone. I am truly sorry."
"I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	Wow. What makes you so empathetic to them?"
"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	You are so right. I am a great coworker but I really dont do a lot to show it."
"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	I try not to let it bother me, but I certainly have had some experiences of mine that I would not want to repeat. It is a very difficult habit to break!"
"My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	oh wow!! tell her that i said congrats"
"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	Wow that's crazy!  How far away do you live?  Does she live on a farm or something?"
"Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	Oh wow! I can only run 1 marathon, but I bet you were exhausted after that lol"
"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	Wow! That is incredible. How far did it get?"
"We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	Congratulations! That sounds like an amazing experience! I've never been to a marathon."
"I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	That would surprise anyone! What made you unsure about this person?"
"She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	I hate to hear that! I hope you feel better."
"I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	That's absolutely understandable."
"How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	Have you talked to a psy, satanist or other person about it?"
"Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	Oh wow!  I bet you're really sorry and sad about this!  What did she say?"
"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	I'm glad she was able to comfort you. It must be so hard seeing your pet hurt like that."
"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	I would be too! I've only been once but it was on a short trip!"
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	That is awesome!  So lucky to have grandparents who lived close.  Disneyland is truly an amazing place!"
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	That's good that you got to talk to him again! Did it make you happy or sad?"
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	Wow, so he's looking for a job now. Good for him. What was the occasion? Do you know why he's looking for a job?"
"Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	Organize is nice! What sort of stuff do you like to pack?"
"Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	That's so fun! It sounds like you are excited to get the hang of it, and it sounds like you have a good idea how it will work out!"
"I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	I know right"
"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	Exactly what I was thinking. If only people would just text or call instead of talking on the phone..."
"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	That is not healthy"
"I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	I'm glad it worked out for you guys"
"I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	awww! that's so sweet!!! It's always amazing when we feel like we don't have anyone to come home too. I'm glad you were able to make friends and be together."
"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	That sounds like a great adventure! How did you find your people?"
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	Do you have an example to give me?  I'm always open to hearing that!"
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	Thank you. Yeah, I'm glad people realize it takes practice to really improve."
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	That was very thoughtful of you, I'm sure he was just trying his best"
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	That is true and he must have gotten upset with you. But mom's love knows no bounds! He can always find something on his plate!"
"There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	That's mean!  Were you able to confront them and ask them why they did it?"
"Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	That is nice."
"Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	I understand what you mean"
"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	I completely agree with that."
"Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	awh i know what you mean i wish they were the size of my palm"
"Are your kids adults now?	No, they're in their twenties, but I still miss them. They used to always go trick or treating at their neighborhood club on weekends, too."
"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	That's wonderful! It feels so good when you feel like you have what you got!"
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	i bet that was a nice day for you"
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.	I can understand that.  It is challenging to make a living and having it decidedly provide for the needs of the family at times, but it is so do worth it."
"We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	Part time jobs can also be stressful"
"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected	Really! How did that make you feel!"
"Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	That's awesome that she's into you! Did you like him at first?"
"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	That sounds really fun! I have never been on a vacation before, and I am really excited for you!"
"We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	Sounds amazing! I hope you guys have fun!"
"I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	Oh nice!  How did it go?"
"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	Wow, that is really frustrating and frustrating. I would be pretty irritated. Did you call her and complain?"
"Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	I would be scared too, what did he look like, like a creepy clown?"
"Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	What grocery store were you at this at?"
"Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	Uh oh, tell me what happened!"
"She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	I'm not sure how that happened. It's not like I'm a smart person."
"Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	What happened? Did everyone get together and throw a trash can in the trash?"
"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	Hahahaha. That must have been funny. Did everyone end up understanding?"
"Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	No. But I really really really hope that you had fun..."
"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!	Did you hear that? The rain didn't get to me. I was so jealous of the Jay and Beyonce performance that I decided to drive up to the parking deck just to get a photo with them!"
"You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...	Whoa! Did you tell them, and how long were you gone for?"
"My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!	Whoa that's crazy, was he a nice guy or a freak, or what?"
"Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!	That sounds like a pleasant surprise!"
"I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!	He must really love you very much!"
"I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!	Hatched eggs are expensive to get rid of."
"This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?	Oh wow! I bet that was an excellent feeling!"
"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?	No"
"As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	Big shoes to fill, that sounds tragic."
"I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	That is some crazy stuff.  How'd it go?"
"I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	That sounds so crazy! I'm glad your friend didn't do anything like that!"
"This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	Oh that's terrible. Did it take you long getting it fixed?"
"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	That's a shame. Do you have any repair plans available for it?"
"I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	Oh, no. That sounds like trouble. How do you feel about that?"
"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	I am glad it worked out for you guys"
"I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	i can imagine it to. Did everything go okay? she must be proud of you"
"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching	I'm glad she was understanding! Sometimes we forget how much a ""mommy"" is."
"THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!	I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!	That sounds wonderful! Where is the condo at?"
"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.	Wow! That sounds awesome! I love the gulf. Do you guys have jet-ski lessons first?"
"I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	That's great! What kind of job did she get?"
"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))	She must have felt so accomplished. I wish I had the drive to do that. You sound like an awesome parent."
"Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	Oh my gosh! I have never done that, but I hate that. It's inconsiderate and just causes more mess and drama."
"Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	Some people are just jerks! That's annoying."
"WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)	I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!	You must be so excited!"
"We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.	That is awesome!  I am happy that she is your wife!  You must be very excited."
"Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second	I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.	That's so beautiful! How do you get to that ""Flow"" usually- speaking?"
"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	Oh I've done that before actually! And no I'm not familiar with that either."
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	I agree! Leaders should put all their money into running a successful business or business rather than just sitting around doing nothing!"
"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	leader like that is exactly why we needless to be humble"
"I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	That's awesome! I'm glad you had such an awesome day."
"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot"", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.	Ha ha! That's funny, because that's the name of one of our pets in the movie! I was also at the Shedd aquarium as well. I'm glad you made a special trip there and enjoyed the experience!"
"This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt	That sounds great!  I am so happy for you."
"Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards	That's awesome! What a wonderful day to be alive!"
"THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?	I don't know. I wish someone will help me. I am very depressed and suicidal."
"Did they give you any feedback?	I think so but I don?Ât understand why it won?Ât let you off the hook for the second offense?"
"That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.	I did but they said I didn't listen so well."
"So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.	That is so exciting! I am sure it will go very well!"
"I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	Congratulations!  That's so exciting!  I'm so happy for you and your family!"
"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	Ha ha, no I had to cancel my cable subscription.  I tried rewiring the router but it would take forever!"
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	I watched netflix last week actually. I was quite happy"
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	What is the twist?"
"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	That's great! You worked so hard for that chance!"
"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.	Wow that's amazing! Good for you!"
"Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job	Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!	I know! It takes me an extra 20 minutes or so in traffic to go a decent city park! So aggravating!"
"Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes	Oh man! I bet that was aggravating! Were you on your phone when it happened?"
"The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.	Did it ever get better? Or worse?"
"And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.	I think the Grudge was a pretty scary movie! I don't get scared easily lol. What did you do in the end though"
"My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.	That's awesome! I am happy for her!"
"She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.	That's wonderful. I am glad that you're happy for her!"
"I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.	Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown.	How did that make you feel"
"I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.	That's a bummer! Maybe there's something wrong with it? That's usually the culprit!"
"I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too.	I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out	Oh boy did it already!  What did you get?"
"Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!	That sounds like an exciting day! I have 3 dogs myself."
"When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them	That was really nice of them.  Did you have to move very far away?"
"Yes, I am always better off with them as my parents, they want to see us succeed	That's so wonderful. I'm lucky to have great family."
"Yes, it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.	That's really good that you have that kind of relationship with them"
"Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married	Congrats!  How long have you been married for?"
"My friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary. He easily makes 200,000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him.	People get crazy when it comes to salary."
"Yeah, that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance, and is on call a lot.	Those malpractice rates make it hard for many people. I hope he gets a raise soon, though!"
"True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.	I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future	Did you get any concrete answers for the questions that he was asking you?"
"I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path	That's great! What kind of doctor are you going to be?"
"That is disgusting! What can you do about about it?	Nothing really, it just sorta happened naturally, you know?"
"You could chat to them and complain!	You could also try reporting the post to the authorities!"
"Who knows, I guess it depends on how reasonable they are.	One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at, my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.	Wow, did you do it"
"I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.	That was so nice of them!  I'm glad you had a good friend like that!"
"She also has 2 daughters, 2 and 7, and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.	That's amazing!  It's nice to have a roof over my head when you can finally afford it.  Good for you staying with her!"
"I've known them since the moment they were born, but it will still be a blast.	Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood	I can feel the nostalgia now! What did you like best from the time period"
"I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era	I do feel like toys r us is still somewhat alive and kicking. They have a lot of classic toys"
"The other day I came across a Facebook post showing all the old stuff from the 90's.. it took me way back to my childhood.	I love that feeling! 90s were a good time. Do you have a favorite band or favorite album?"
"Oh no, it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends, food, toys, tv shows, etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.	I do love a good 90's Facebook posting"
"How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.	I was just a baby in the 80s. I can see the trends and what everyone is wearing today. I'm glad things were easier back then!"
"Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.	I hate bullies. Playground or politics, I find them intolerable.	I agree bullies make me so mad!"
"Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?	Yes, but unfortunately I always get called names."
"I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.	I have never seen the new one, is it good?"
"Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.	That's cool to hear! What movie is it?"
"My parents keep taking my money	Do they report it to you as well?  I know they try to hide it from you if it's not enough for your bills lol.  What do they do?"
"They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.	I feel your pain. I once got evicted and then got a second home with parents that paid for everything."
"So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a ""mommy"" will come along to clean up after them?!	Exactly! And they think they can just do it all on their own without being asked! How aggravating"
"LOL! Okay, y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)	They don't think about the children. They don't care about them either though. Some people just aren't considerate."
"The hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on Christmas of 2007.	that is so sad, i am really sorry for your loss"
"She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up, she slipped.	That's terrible. I hope she didn'tREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREM....lol....sorry for laughing"
"It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it, but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.	That was a tough one to watch! I'm glad you have someone to talk to about it!"
"It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.	That's so sweet! Roxie sounds like a lovely name!"
"A few years ago, there was a time that I really needed a car. I had to go to school and my husband worked full time.	Did you find a new car to ride?"
"We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!	That was really nice of someone."
"Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind.	I know right, some people are just unbelievable. I am glad you got to enjoy yourself!"
"Have you ever had a surprise birthday party planned for you? I did a few years back.	No - I'm too introverted.  Did you enjoy it at the end?"
"That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year.	Yes, me too. I was begging him to throw me a surprise birthday too! It was so fun. I really had a lot of fun planning it. What was it about?"
"Haha! Yes! And what's really funny, is that I almost missed it because I wasn't actually expecting it and almost didn't get back in time! Whoops.	It was raining hard one night and the power shut off	That happens often?"
"Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles	Rain can be such a damper. What do you do to get rid of the smell?"
"One time I studied my butt off for my first psychology exam. It was hard and I studied all night.	How did that turn out?"
"I ended up actually getting a 98%!	wow you must have been very confident that day"
"Haha I always thought that was a funny term too. That's amazing. Psychology is absolutely fascinating.	Do you have any pets?	Yeah I have a dog. What kind do you have"
"Yes. We got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! He's such a night owl and is always banging into stuff.	My cat drives me nuts too and he just wants to lay on me!"
"My son graduated.	Congrats! What did you teach him?"
"Highschool.	Congrats! It's such an awesome experience! What did he do that you were proud of him?"
"One of the hardest times in my life was when I had to leave my husband and daughter when I went through a divorce.	I am so sorry. How did you do it?"
"I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.	I'm so very sorry, that must have been difficult. I know it's because we've grown up in the same family and know the feeling well - but it's important to remember your loved ones and let those you love know where you are, thank you very much."
"It was, but I grew so much from it, and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.	I know this guy who is so young, yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.	How young are we talking?"
"He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.	Wow he is really starting to make some good coin-selling beans! I wish I had some myself!"
"I feel slightly bad. I think I hurt my mom's feelings last week because she told me about a necklace I got rid of when I was a kid. She's a packrat and I'm really, really not.	Why would you think that is a bad necklace."
"I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said ""Special Sister"". I'm probably a jerk..	You're not jerk. I think you should totally put that necklace back on."
"No, they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.	That is so sweet! I am happy that both of you have someone like your aunt who will help you in times of need! You deserve it"
"Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?	Yes, it is great when that happens. I once went to an episode of castle rock. I was so taken back."
"Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..	Yeah i know how you feel i used to listen to pandora and it was crazy listening to that songs and reliving those times."
"lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)	I was just thinking about how a few years ago, we lost our cat.	I am so sorry to hear about that."
"It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :(	Oh no, I hope you found all your cats ok."
"Thank you. I appreciate that.	I'm sorry to hear that. I had a dog die once too.	Oh no. I am sorry to hear that too. What kind of dog were you having at the time?"
"The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha	Oh no. I hope your at least somewhat okay. The doctors can't exactly do a thing about dying pets these days unfortunately"
"Agreed, definitely not. I actually work in radiation oncology and see cancer every day at work.	Once I ate a raw oyster because my uncle offered me some and I contracted food poisoning. Things were coming out from both ends, so gross.	eww that's so gross."
"Extremely, but it passed after a day or so. Never consume raw shellfish, unless sushi because they properly prepare it	Oh wow! I can totally imagine how gross that would have been! I'm sorry to that for you!"
"You don't care for sushi that much?	I recently had a prank played on me. My friend pretended to be dead and used ketchup as a prop!	What! You are the worst kind of friend."
"I ended up being very upset at first and then laughed it off!	What was the prank?"
"My boyfriend of five years and I broke up. I don't know what to do with my life.	That's too bad. Are there any positive aspects to this break up?"
"I don't think so. He wants to join the military since his dad has passed away and I'm not sure if that's the lifestyle I want.	That is sad. Do you think there is a way to bring yourself to accept it?"
"I think we're going to try long distance while I finish up school (3 more years). But it's just scary thinking of it all.	That is scary, but you need to think positive. Long distance can be good though."
"We have dogs and chameleons together, so it's like we're already a little family haha	Well as long as you have something to look forward too it shouldn't be that bad!"
"I recently found out the girl I love may not feel the same way. This makes me sad.	That's sad but also makes you remember why you loved her in the first place"
"I hope so. Maybe one day, but I am not so sure.	I'm sorry, I hope it turns out well for you."
"I feel pretty hopeful towards this woman that I really enjoy. I am trying to date her.	What makes you feel that?"
"I think she has expressed interest in me in the past, but she recently moved, but she is not too far away. I might ask her on a date the next time I am around.	That's great. She'll probably say no since she's not your girlfriend anymore."
"I am very lucky, my friends are so great. What's the best birthday you have had?	I dont have friends, so what is the best gift you have ever received?"
"Wow, I am impressed! My friends just show me love and buy me tequila aha!	Oh that is awesome, I have never even thought of that ha! Well its always nice to get some new people to hang out with."
"For sure, maybe you need new friends!	5	4"
"I recently had an argument with my sister. It made us both very annoyed.	Oh no. What happened?"
"I recently had a scary experience. I heard gunshots on my street.	Oh my gosh. I hope you are okay!!!"
"Everything turned out fine. I think somebody in the nearby neighborhoods may have been hurt, though.	That would be scary. I hope your neighborhood is okay!"
"Do you know the feeling of drinking a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows on a cold winter's night?	Yeah, I love mugging strangers on the side of the road. Especially in freezing temperatures."
"Next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it. It's extremely relaxing and sleep-inducing haha	Oh yes! That sounds very relaxing. Do you do that frequently?"
"I live in Louisiana, so it's very rare that I get to enjoy it. I've had it maybe three or four times in my lifetime. It just left a lasting impression.	I love my mom. She does her best to provide for me, even to this day.	She sounds like a good mom! How old is she?"
"I tell her I love her and also send her gifts from time to time. She doesn't live too close to me but I try.	That's sweet. It sounds like she really loves you."
"You know, that is tough, but it happens to the best of us. What went wrong?	I don't know, we're still dating."
"But you failed the exam? Did you revise?	Yeah I did but it's not the same thing you failed if it was a completely different class. It was calculus and I didn't understand it so I had to take it again. I felt so bad but I guess it wasn't that bad. Yes I failed the exam"
"At least you know for next time eh?	My mom helped me buy a car. She's the best.	That's great, your mom is awesome"
"She's amazing. Do you love your mom?	I love her. What kind of a car is it"
"I think that the girl of my dreams likes somebody else. I feel very sad about it.	Oh no, is there anyone in her life that you could fall back too?"
"It's tough because she has been out of the country for a month, so I will likely discuss it when she returns.	Oh no. Maybe she will come back. Just try to have faith that everything will turn out ok."
"That sounds tough. What do you do/	I teach English as a first language. I am having a tough year. I am scared to even leave my house. School has started back up and it's intimidating. Luckily, my boss is super cool and understanding."
"That sounds like hard work. I hope you are paid well.	I work in sales, but I'm not very well off. I'm worried I won't make enough money to pay for my mortgage and bills. I'm worried about losing my job."
"Fair enough. As long as you look after your back""	I have only a few more semesters in college. I feel very hopeful about my chances of finishing.	That's good! I hope you do well in college!"
"Environmental engineering! I enjoy it, but I wouldn't say it is my passion in life.	That's cool.  Are you in college?"
"I watch so many scary movies that I haven't been able to sleep alone in years due to fear.	I used to do the same but now I have a surround sound system and block out most scary movies. It is really nice to not be afraid of something for a change!"
"I honestly don't know. I've always been fascinated with them since being a little girl and that fascination has never gone away.	I think I've only watched like 2 or 3  movies like that in the last year, but last time I was alone at home I tried watching Kindergarten by itself...it was okay, nothing special really.  Now I keep thinking about it and it's kind of funny.  So weird."
"I've been telling myself that for years, I just have no self control. What are your favorite kinds of movies?	I like romantic movies and comedies. Anything really, I dont know."
"What is your favorite scary movie at the moment?	None of the above. Which movie do you like?"
"Donald Trump is now the president. It makes me feel bad about life.	Well, he is not that bad yet. He still has time to change."
"I agree. I am glad real conservatives are in opposition to him, too.	Real Conservatives don't want Trump in office. That makes him look like a Communist.  I don't get it.  Are you confusing Trump with Ronald MacDonald?"
"I am now going to be a master's student. I will got to he University of Florida	Wow, congratulations! That's great. What are you studying?"
"Environmental Engineering is my major. I enjoy it.	That is great! I was just accepted to my university as well! That is pretty awesome!"
"I have been feeling very faithful these days. My lover treats me so well.	That's amazing! I love love my girlfriend so much, she's the best!"
"He is really nice and provides for me well. He is also very sweet and very respectful.	That's wonderful! I am glad that you feel that way! You deserve it!"
"Do you like to go through old family pictures?	Yes, I do. What are your favorite ones?"
"Absolutely. I love to hear my mÃ¡mÃ¡ tell me stories from her childhood trapping nutria and trawling with her family.	I do like old family pictures.  Do they bring you back some good memories?"
"I also love to look through the old scrapbooks my mom made when I was a baby and young child. I find it's so funny to see what you looked like as a child.	I recently found out that the woman of my dreams like another. I am incredibly jealous of him.	I am sure he will be the one that makes you fall in love with."
"I have not told her as much as I need to. I am trying to build the courage.	You definitely should. Women are loyal no mater how much or how long you've been banging them!"
"How long?	An hour"
"About what exactly?	How long do you have to live with your partner after an argument or when you lose them in a court, for instance?"
"Now that is an interesting perspective!	My mother recently went to the bank for me. I love her so much.	That is a nice surprise! Are you going to spend a lot of time together?"
"Nice people are the best. Empathy is something we all need more of!	My mother is going to be moving soon, so it makes me feel a lot better to hear that people are still nice around here!"
"My father almost died. His recent health problems have been devastating.	Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that! Are you doing all that you can to help?"
"It is tough, but I think I will make it.	Oh no! How long has it been? I am so sorry to hear that!"
"My friend bought a new car. This makes me so jealous!	Why is that made you jealous"
"It makes me feel inferior. Hopefully I will get over it.	It sucks that jealousy runs strong in this world, but I know you can get there, too. Just gotta stay positive!"
"I recently met a new person that I am very fond of. I want to give her my love and care.	That's really nice!  How has your relationship been?"
"I am very happy, too. Do you have someone special in your life?	I do! I love my partner, our dog, my best friend!"
"My family is very loving. They care about me so much.	That's so great! I love that about mine."
"I agree. I hope you are also close to your family!	I am very close with my family too! It is awesome that you have such a great connection with your family!"
"I stole my friend's Pokemon card when we were 7. I still feel guilty about it.	Why did you do that"
"Yes	Why did you do that"
"I one time lost my trunks in the pool! People saw me in a way I didn't want!	Oh no! I hope they didn't laugh as much at you."
"I covered my body and then went to the bathroom and got a towel!	Oh man, I am glad I wasn't there when you went through that!"
"I recently graduated from college. I loved it and now I feel great about my life!	Congratulations! You sound like a hard working person now"
"I agree. I am thinking about moving to the West Coast of the USA.	that is a great idea, im sure it is much cheaper there, and also have a lot more work available there"
"we went for a doctor visit because she was	Where did the doctor go for visit for?"
"sorry lol. because she was ""late"". but she told me the result was negative, not pregnant. so then we went to a furniture store just to browse	Oh lol. Well that was a nice surprise then. Good luck with everything else."
"well here's the thing. We are married. Been together 5 years. So as I'm walking around looking at stuff in this store, I notice a bookmark hanging off the ear of a wooden rocking horse!	Having the whole house to your self sometimes isn't as good as it may seem!	I know!  Sometimes you need some space for the whole family!"
"My whole family is out the house for a few months. I'm going to be so bored with no one around...	I feel you! Sometimes I feel lonely because I don't know what to do or where to go. I hope you feel better though and don't feel bored!"
"I have a huge chance to win a PS4!	That's awesome! What are you going to do to win?"
"There's only 2 other people in the final round! Winning a PS4 will be awesome!	You sound very hopeful!"
"My son really needs to cut down on the amount of sugary snacks he has!	You mean increase his intake!?"
"Well, my wife gets them on deals, so likes to hoard them in the cupboard.	You're husband sounds a little entitled.  My kid just refuses to go to the bathroom!"
"the house is very quiet now that she's been gone for four days visiting with her family	I can imagine. How long has she been gone?"
"because she hasn't seen them in almost 2 years. Misses them	That is too bad. Maybe she should visit on her own time?"
"In the middle of the station, on my new suit, a seagull threw up on me!	Oh god! Was it a nest or something more gross?"
"I was! I had to travel all the way home with a huge mess on me!	That sounds terrible!"
"Paddington Train Station.	I can't believe someone half my age got promoted instead of me!	I'm sure that sucks"
"Have you ever missed out on a promotion?	I have. I've even worse in management situations.  Why did they pick him/her?"
"My wife cried quite a lot at her mothers funeral. They had a very close bond.	Thats sad. Were you close to them?"
"Unfortunately she passed away, hence the funeral.	I'm so sorry for the loss. How long did it have?"
"Getting this new job should be easy. I am easily the best person that applied.	What job did you apply for?"
"CEO of Apple. I figured they need a Steve 2.0 to take them forward!	Congrats. I hope it goes well."
"ok, so after 5 years and the baby, there was disconnect. Things like not sleeping at the same times, not even hardly talking. Just avoiding each other really	That's terrible, I hope everything worked out for the best!"
"plenty lol. kicked them out long time ago. now with new wife of 5 years haha. but point is, i never cheated even during those 8 months of feeling alone, heck, BEING alone	Well that's good. You are lucky."
"as bill & ted would say: Excellent! {guitar}	LOL....You said it like that without irony. You said nothing about cheating. You said plenty. You are very lucky that your wife is so trustworthy."
"My son is such a rascal! He took my car for a joy ride!	I hope you got it back! That is mean"
"He's only 13! I didn't even think he had that in him!	What a rascal!!! What did you do to make him behave!"
"My brother...Dating an A list supermodel... I don't know what to think!	What if it turns out that he's really into you..."
"He's dating Kylie Jenner. Have you heard of her?	No, I haven't. What is she like?"
"Justin Beiber.	Have anything to tell me about?	Not really? You seem curious. What's been going on?"
"Oh wow, I can imagine. How old was it?	I was 13 at the time. What about you?"
"That's rough, but I'm sure you can get past that.	Starbucks always get's my order wrong!	They do! Have you tried emailing them?"
"They definitely are expensive. What's your favourite drink to get?	Haven't tried Starbucks in a while, I usually get caramel"
"I'm so happy for my son, went to his graduation from Harvard last week.	That's awesome. What did he graduate in?"
"Thank you! Looks like there's going to be another Doctor in the family!	That's great. My parents went to college and my son's dad worked a few jobs to make enough to attend. I hope you have an awesome gradation!"
"My pizza I bought fell all over the floor on my way home!	Dang! Did you get a second one?"
"The pizza was from my favourite pizza shop as well! Quite the sad moment.	Oh wow, I hope you didn't have to spend too much on the pizza"
"I was getting keys out of my pocket, and then WHAM, right on the floor. The pineapple slices were the first to fall on the floor.	Why does McDonalds always get my order wrong! I said no lettuce!	They know your lettuce needs you"
"Sometimes I think the management don't even care!	That would make me mad"
"I ate so much of my wife's cookies, but she shouldn't make them so irresistible.	Oh no! You shouldn't do that to her! Maybe you should buy her a good present."
"She made me pay twice what they would have sold for at the bake sale. The cookies were for charity, you see.	Oh no! Well maybe she wanted them because you two are friends!"
"Just my luck I step into a huge pile of dog mess...	Eeewwww! Are you sick?"
"That is true, cow poop is much worst! But I was wearing brand new Gucci flip flops!	Oh no! Did the dog wash his feet after?"
"The key to making good chicken and rice, is following the recipe precisely	Which recipe is that?  My favorite?"
"You've got to cut up all the ingredients, and put it in small containers, before finally cooking all at once.	I have never tried that, but it is a great idea."
"we asked the doc to put the ultrasound in an envelope so we could record our reaction to the gender reveal. I was very happy when I finally saw it!	Wow, that's so exciting. Were you worried at all about the results?"
"thanks. no mistake about it, it's a boy! lol. Takes after his father ;)	I bet that was a surprise and you were happy about that!"
"Holy Moses!! don't quit trying :)	My son failed his exams! Can you believe it! I don't know what to do!	Oh no, that's terrible :( What kind of exams? He could've taken an English class I'm sure."
"He spent all his time playing football instead of studying! I warned him about this!	I hope he learns his lesson. Football can be hectic at nights!"
"Without prayer, I don't know if I would have passed that important test!	i am praying for you, pray tell me what happened if i could help you!"
"It was a test in Numeracy, so counting 1 - 100. I've always found that difficult, but god made it possible!	You will know for sure on your test if and when you passed!"
"Hey! I saw a blind man play a guitar once. Was so surreal and I was so impressed	I would love to see that"
"Yea. I think he was. His story was crazy too. He is an orphan	What was the name of the guitar?"
"we were 20 mins from the airport and the car broke down, overheated and would not start !	oh no, sorry to hear that, was your flight delayed?"
"had to hitch hike. made it on time for check in though. now the cars been in the shop 4 days, no progress. kinda getting worried about it	Oh, wow! I'm sorry you had to deal with that inconvenience. I hope everything turned out alright for the most part."
"My son was just born, my first boy after 11 girls!	Wow! That's amazing! Congratulations! You have some pretty amazing daughters to choose from. You must be so happy and proud!"
"It's easier if you had 12 different baby mamas, that's my trick anyway. This last labour was 6 hours long!	I remember those days! I used to have one as well, but due to a health issue they had to move us down the list and unfortunately that meant we would have to homeschool our oldest."
"Some times at night, I can hear some shouting ""AHHHHHHH"", ""HEE HEE"".	Is it someone in your neighborhood?"
"No, the spooky thing is... I think it's the ghost of Michael Jackson. I even saw him dancing to Billie Jean.	That would freak me out"
"My best friend is doing 30 years in prison. I miss my good friend.	Why is he in prison"
"I can't visit him. I've had to flee the country. We were robbing banks together, and he got caught with half the cash. I'm currently in the Bahamas.	That is horrible! I hope Bahamas does better for him!"
"My son worked for many years to be a footballer, he finally signed a pro contract!	Wow! How old is your son now, are you proud?"
"He's just joined Juventus. Can't be more happy for the lad.	Great, that kid will be world class one day!"
"4 months later he will be here. It has taken me around 3 months to save up enough money to be ready for him when he's born	3 months?! That's pretty darn fast! I hope you have a nice surprise."
"yes it is. I am very happy	That's great! It's hard to wait to get kids!"
"only child for now. name is RAIDEN (god of thunder) :D	On my way home from work, a massive bat chased me!	Did it hurt you? I've always been scared of bats"
"I know! This one was absolutely huge, almost human sized. Chased me for a whole hour. The more I think about it, it might have been the batman! I shouldn't have stolen those diamonds!	Maybe you should think about returning the favor and let your imagination run with what you had stolen. Maybe that batman had a crush on you."
"Every day I thank God for my blessings. I'd be in hole right now if it weren't for HIM	Thats right. some people say if you believe everything you see, you dont need a blessing"
"especially since he takes care of us even though don't deserve it	Amen to that"
"Once during an important school sporting event, my entire sports team was counting on me but mid-way through my event, my shorts fell down and I tripped	Oh no! Did you get hurt at any stage?"
"yea! it was! I thought everyone would be annoyed at me but the next day when I went back to school, everyone just made it a joke so its alright. This was about 5-6 years ago now haha	That is hilarious!  I am glad it wasn't embarrassing!"
"I love youtube. been listening to all my classic tracks. Tupac forever	Tupacs were such a cool thing when I was a kid. You must have some really good memories."
"I started out with one hit wonders but ended up at Pac. I miss my youth lol	LOL at least you were active when you made that connection!"
"When I was younger, my dog died. He was getting up there in age, but he was still on the young side. Later, we heard the pet food we had been feeding him had been recalled because of similiar fatalities.	That sucks. I hope your did everything right to bring him up to date."
"No, they just had a recall. Apparently they didn't clean out their machines properly when making the food, so it got contaminated.	That's too bad. It's always sad when pet dies, but at least it wasn't something too tragically tragic like losing a child."
"Seeing people who have less than me just makes me so grateful for the blessings I have been given	Less fortunate then I suppose... I was born with low self- esteem, but I've since managed to wipe it out."
"absolutely! Always give to people who have less than myself :)	It's always nice to help those who have nothing to gain by others giving."
"hiding for almost 2 years but I'm still not over my paranoia that one day I will have to pay for what I did. Don't ask what it was	What did you do?"
"no way. I just pray she can forgive me. I could never admit to this sin. Jesus save me	That is very specific. I hope you can be fully forgiven."
"When I was a kid, I went to this group with other kids my age, it was in a big gym. There were kids of different ages, and one of the kids (8 years old or so) was picking on the littler kids. So, when he had his back turned, I looped him with a hoola hoop and tripped him so he fell flat on his face.	Lousy mofoe!  I bet you felt terrible about it!"
"Yeah, I was pretty amazed in the moment, he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face. I had to watch for a moment in awe, before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So, I ran towards where the parents were seated, stopped when I turned the corner, and walked calmly over to my mom, taking a seat on her lap. I looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner, and I forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop, I looked like a helpless victim.	I love that moment when I see the kids going through the process of the gym, I'm like, what are we talking about six years old, I don't need to be in pain but I want to be in pain. I'm just like, I'll take the bad thing and be like, okay with it"
"after she got her 1st job and new car, she started doing girls night out. Out until 3am one morning. I checked her chat history and sure enough she had kissed another guy >:(	What a crazy and wild time. People do weird things when they first meet someone, and it makes you feel bad even though it's probably in the back of their mind."
"jealous isn't the one I felt. I wanted to rip her apart lol	Wow that's pretty extreme! But maybe she found someone who's into her."
"My dad always worked his ass off at a job he didn't like in order to support us, doing a lot of back breaking work as a caretaker. He even had a second job at Wal-mart for a while. I have no idea how he managed to do that sort of thing.	He sounds like an awesome dad"
"Yeah, especially because we were single income. My mom homeschooled my brother and I. I think he took only a handful of sick days his entire time working, had something like 600 days saved up when he retired.	Wow, he sounds like an awesome guy. He sounds like he could handle anything!"
"I think he got 3 weeks a year, only used like 5 days.	Wow, he must've got a real job then."
"my instincts are never wrong. I found out her lies when I checked her facebook chat history.	That's awful! Did you tell her the truth?"
"she arranged to meet up with her ex to return his t-shirt! why do that behind my back? we had just started seeing each other. Made me so mad	That's really mean and cruel of her.  I'm glad it all worked out though!"
"I never thought she would tell anyone and make it seem like I did something wrong. I didn't force her	What happened?"
"ye and so I had to leave the country because of her	Where did she originally live. She was never nice to you in person?"
"Public school really sucks sometimes. Making boys shower all together. I didn't want to but had to or else fail PE	PE?ressive environment?!? I didn't think it was that bad, PE was definitely a letdown for me!"
"yes. Well it was a long time ago but I haven't forgotten	It's always better to do good and do well then to make a girl wet."
"My mom homeschooled me when I was little. I was in public school till first grade, but after that I was homeschooled. Did take a semester in grade 11 though to make sure I was up to current standards.	That is impressive.  Were you ever afraid to call upon the teacher when the time was right?"
"Really? I didn't even know that was an option. Then again I'm 25 so it may not have been available then.	What school do you go to now? That's awesome that she had that kind of education and was able to get you started, it's rare."
"I still haven't got over it. Brandon Lee RIP. I was 17 when I found out he died during filming. I visited the area he took his last steps a couple years ago	Oh my goodness. That's so sad. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Were you close with him in some way?"
"Now the remake is well on its way. Maybe it can lift this depression I feel if they stay true to the story. Jason Mamoa isn't bad looking	Oh wow I completely agree, I feel like they are trying too hard to shoe horn in more death and tragedy in movies!"
"I had to adapt to life. I had to change to survive. Now I feel better	adapt or die"
"I am reminded every day that I can survive anything. A friend gave me a special bracelet (paracord)	Cool, that always makes for good bracelet. What kind of things do you do with the bracelets?  bracelet sold separately?"
"I recently found out a good friend of mine has been cheating on her fiance for years.	That's terrible.  She's not someone I would want to date anyway.  Why did she do it?  I'm not sure I get it"
"Very angry and frustrated that she would behave that way. It makes me think less of her as a person.	That's such an unacceptable thing to do. I hope she steps back up or lets him know how she feels."
"I was sucker punched when I was 17. The guy broke his hand and fled the scene. I saw him one time after this riding a bicycle but didn't do anything.	That's pretty terrifying, did you report it?"
"I wasn't confident. Now I regret not punishing him.	That's a real suckerpunch, my man. What bike did you use? That's a real life saver when you don't have time to do stuff!"
"I recently completed my masters degree in education at almost 40 years old. I feel really pleased with myself.	that is great, what was your previous degrees?"
"Thanks! It was a huge challenge, and I'm SO glad to have it behind me!	That's great! Congratulations! I am currently in the process of getting my bachelor's degree."
"Being a mom is great, too! And you never know- maybe you'll go back to school in the future! Thanks!	Yes! My husband had a surgery a few weeks ago. I stayed home with my baby and did everything we needed, including diaper changing."
"I feel happy about the new house I have and that I can work from home. Thanks be to God	That is great. Some people can be so hard on money"
"It took me 9 months of determination and sacrifice. But worth it.	It's great that you worked hard for it."
"I blamed myself for her fall because I wasn't close enough to prevent it. I took care of her for months afterwards.	Was she okay"
"I was distracted by the sound of running water.	That's good, how old was she when she hurt her?"
"I can't get enough of music today. Especially all my songs/bands from when I was in my twenties.	Why don't you try listening to new songs/art thou"
"Its true though, they can't make good music these days. Not in ANY genre.	I know what you mean. I listen to the same kinds over and over."
"I get paid today and I'm getting this new game I've been waiting on to be released!	What game is it?"
"I'm thinking about getting FarCry 5. I pre-order for the early release! I'm really excited about it.	That sounds really exciting! Which one are you getting?"
"Hi, I joined a firm 6 months ago and then I got a promotion for Junior Manager	Congratulations on your promotion!"
"yes, They thought that I have some extraordinary talent and that is the reason I got that position	Wow, that's quite a long time ago, do you still have your current job?"
"Maybe yes, Haha, Now I am looking for a Manager post and then become a senior manager	Wow, I bet that's a lot of work! But, it sounds like you've found your calling, which I'm happy for."
"Hi, I have applied for a driving license thrice and I have failed in all the thee	Have you always been this DMV apocolypse? I'm sorry that you're going through that wracking!"
"Yes, I am a little uncomfortable driving backwards. I just can't do that.	Have you tried to do the test over again?"
"every time I try not to hit that cone but those are so close.	You should try a dmv."
"I still can't believe my life is where it's at, especially if you look at the past few years. I would never believe you if you told me I would be here.	What happened?"
"Well, for many years I was an alcoholic, working for near minimum wage in kitchens. But that all changed when I was accepted to University!	That's great.  It's such a bittersweet moment.  It can be a good lesson for you, even if it's not right then.  But you must be grateful to have that degree in order not to go through worse."
"It does. I worked really hard to pass the acceptance tests, and I couldn't believe when I passed with flying colors!	That's awesome! Congratulations! What are you studying right now?"
"Yesterday, I was standing in a lift and a man next to me whispered in my ears that your zip is open.	What? That's not something you hear very often, have you heard anyone else say it recently?"
"It was just very creepy situation	What was your reaction"
"lol thats funny	My hubby lost his job a couple of months ago but he has an interview this friday so i pray he will get that job	That's really good for him. I hope he does great interviews."
"armed security	Oh I hope so too! I bet you're nervous! Is he a hard worker?"
"I stayed alone at night in a office due to excessive work and was much scared.	Oh no! You had to be alone?"
"no, I was on a 10th floor and security was down. I was scared even with a single noise.	I am scared of stairs, it's one the worst fears I have as well.  Did you do any major renovations?"
"I have been awarded with a degree in marketing.	That's fantastic. You must be very excited."
"it took 4 years but at last got it	Congratulations! It's always satisfying to see a good job done well by someone with a good degree"
"Yeah,  I have  a job that I was looking for and now I am really enjoying my life.	Hey, have you ever been in a car wreck?	I have, it's no fun. What happened?"
"I was in one about 2 years ago. No one was hurt, but it totaled both of our cars.	Omg, Ive been in ones like that too! It is so terrifying! How did it happen?!"
"Have you everr been in a fist fight with anyone?	Yes, I certainly was in high school."
"I got in a fist fight with my step father once. It wasn't a fun experience as you can imagine.	Oh no! Did you guys reconcile and work things out?"
"Have you ever played and old video game called Everquest?	I sure have.  Those games were amazing back then!"
"It came out in 1999. I used to play it when i was a teen. I installed it the other day and had a good time playing.	I did, I played it a ton as a kid too"
"Have you ever eaten at Hardee's?	Oh yes many years ago. They are a classic"
"I like it too, but I'm not a big fan of their new sliders. They're so tiny, and just one of them cost almost 2 dollars!	No, I haven't. I always get the big sliders. They're the grossest things. You're right though, they're really cheap."
"Have you ever had a sleep paralysis dream?	no, I don't know what that is."
"Yeah, in mine I saw a smoke looking shadow over me with red eyes staring at me. I've never been more scared in my life.	I have had those. They are terrifying"
"Have you ever rode on a roller coaster?	Yes, many times."
"I hate riding them, but i used to machine components for their drive chain when I was a machinist.	I have not rode one. I always wanted one."
"A while back my friend's boyfriend tried to get me to have an intimate relationship with him. He knew I had been married a very long time, as well as he was in a relationship with my friend. I turned him down flat, as I love my husband very much.	That is disappointing news. You should ask your friend if he would do anAMA about the situation."
"Yes, I let him know that was wrong and disgusting. I couldn't believe he did it!	I can see why your friends boyfriend thought it would be wrong.  He may have been a little jealous?"
"Yes, as I am honest with him. But, I didn't want trouble.	I'm going overseas and I think I packed everything i need!	Where are you going? I hope its not too far."
"Going to Kazakhstan. That's where i was born. My parents still live there and i miss them so much	Where did you go?"
"Hi, My girlfriend was recently let go of her job, but she put so much work in to finding a new job and got one with better pay!	She deserves better pay for her hard work!"
"Yes I agree, she was so happy when she found out the job was hers	Thats good. I bet she is happy too"
"She wasn't really fired, her position was no more. Schools don't have much room left for Home Ec teachers. Sad	that sucks, teachers deserve some respect but cantylittle til they get fired"
"Yeah she has a passion for teaching. These kids will be great to work with.	So about a year ago now, my girlfriend decided to surprise me with a puppy!	A puppy for a month, that's cute"
"Yes, so nice!! It was the best thing that could've happened! It's a German Shepherd!	Awe how sweet! I bet it brought a tear to your eye!"
"There was this one time I was fairly drunk at a bar and this attractive girl was trying to make moves on me, but I did my best to ignore it all.. Having a girlfriend and all.	It happens to the best of us! Did things work out?"
"I was very proud definitely when I woke up the next morning and knew no mistakes were made!	Wow, it sounds like you have a very open and cooperative personality. That's very commendable!"
"There was this one time my girlfriend and I had plans to meet a Longhorn steakhouse for a date.. She ended up keeping me waiting inside 30 extra minutes! I was pretty frustrated.	That is annoying, but if it's for a special occasion, I'm sure she understand"
"Yes, she actually had a legit reason so I couldn't be too mad at her.. She definitely made it up to me!	She must've been really hungry!"
"I'm just so happy it's finally Friday!	Me too!!! Do you have any plans for Friday?"
"i just want to sleep in and then watch movies all day long... but i'm a mom so i don't sleep in. ever	I feel you. My son just went back to school and I'm just glad it's over."
"I had to cancel a trip to see my brother after it started snowing heavily.	Wow. I hope the snow didn't cancel your trip too much!"
"Yes, when the snow builds up on the road I get nervous, and during this trip I couldn't even see where the road was and where the ditch began.	Oh man. That's the same reason as me - I don't want to be stuck in traffic!"
"It sure can.  When I decided that I wasn't comfortable driving in such deep snow I literally turned around and went home.	Did you ride home in it on the snow?  or were you stuck on the driveway side?"
"When my parents got divorced when I was a kid, it was one of the hardest things for me.	im sorry thats rough i was never married and in the same boat"
"It does definitely get easier over time I suppose.. Now that I see my life I guess it was for the best.	That's good to hear. It's probably for the best if you stopped worrying so much about it."
"Just the other day my girlfriend and I were getting ready for the beach, but right before we left it started to pour rain.	Rain can be such a damper, how did you manage to get out of it?"
"Well, when looking outside you could see a clear patch in the distance... So we kinda just hoped for the best to wait it out.. We finally did get to go!	That's nice, it would have suckedling if it was raining hard and all of a sudden it rained. Hopefully the weather cleared up soon."
"There was one day after work that my girlfriend was planning a surprise party with a bunch of friends and family.	What were you planning?"
"Yes, the party was for me! I was so shocked and had no clue it was coming.	That is such a cool surprise!"
"There was this one time I stole a shirt from my friend, and I feel pretty guilty about it.	Hmmm, maybe you can return the favor some other time?"
"Because I really liked it, and didn't think he'd care.	How long ago did you steal it? Did he find out?"
"My girlfriend recently went on a business trip for a week, I was very lonely during this experience.	I'm sorry. Are you going to be able to stay by yourself?"
"I mainly just played video games and watched tv.	I am glad she came with you."
"I moved to a new apartment and they didn't accept my dog breed, so I had to give her up. :(	That's too bad. Did you already have her/her?"
"Because here in my area in Florida, there isn't too many options for me.	Aw that really is too bad. I'm sorry. Is it far from your original apartment?"
"My mom doesn't have a ton of money, but last christmas she made sure to get me some awesome things!	That's very nice of her!  It's nice that you were so thoughtful and helpful.  It's nice that she loves you so much."
"She got me a brand new laptop I had been wanting for gaming!	Moms are like that. It's one of the oldest profession."
"I went on this ride at the beach called the Slingshot.. It shoots you super high up in the air.. It was so teriffying, I had so much faith in the ride I wouldn't die!	Sounds like a fun roller coaster. Where did you go on it?"
"It was seriously so scary, I almost pooped myself!	Wow that sounds pretty scary! I'd be scared too! How much did you ride it?"
"There was this time I went to the bar with my girlfriend and once I came out of the restroom, I saw her talking to some guy!	Wowza...what happened...did you have a thing for her or what"
"Well I get super jealous and angry of course.. But in the end it was just a work friend.. Oops!	That's happened to me before! Work friends can be so annoying"
"My dog randomly got up on my couch last week, and just started peeing.. Like what!?!?!??!?!	Did he just want to go on his bender?"
"Not since lunch, so it's actually been about 4 hours.. I hate living on the top floor!	I'm sorry! That is pretty gross"
"I finally graduated college last year, it felt like it took SO long!	Congratulations! You must feel relieved that it is finally happening!"
"Yes, I am so proud of myself for finally accomplishing it!	That is great! I bet you worked really hard to get a good job and find something good to do with your time!"
"My girlfriend saw me kissing another girl, who was kissing ME at the bar.. I was very drunk..	Did she notice when you noticed?"
"No.. I realized the mistake I made and took action so it never would happen again.	That sounds like it was a wise move on your part."
"There was this one time I was driving down the road, and this guy on a sports bike popped a wheelie.. It was so sick!	I hate when that happens!  Ive seen a guy do a wheelie in a grocery store once."
"I know! I do too.. I think I need to learn to ride a sports bike first.. Hehe oops!	Hah that sounds like fun!"
"When i was younger, I came back to the house with my family to find our family pet dead.	That sucks.  I hope it wasn't something you did accidentally."
"He was very old, so I guess we were all expecting it.. He lived a good life!	awww what a sad day.. how old was he?"
"My dog chewed a hole in my carpet 2 weeks ago.. I was very disgusted to say the least!	Oh no! I would have been so mad at him! Were you able to get him to take it easy after?"
"Oh dang, I guess I can't complain too much then, that's brutal!	I hate when that happens! I have a dog that chewed a piece of carpet too recently, luckily."
"I have to go to confession at the church... i was a little mean to my mom, sometimes its difficult to be always nice	That sounds rough. What did she do? Is there anyway you can make it right?"
"Well yes when i shouted and i inmeaditelly apologize but i feel really bad	Its okay, you were just being mean. I know how it is to be angry at your parents."
"We walked, we ate ice cream, we rode a bike, we laughed a lot, we enjoyed the outdoors, we were exhausted	Sounds great! Where did all of this happen?"
"I had time that I did not share with the children and that was something that was pending in my soul	wow what an outdoorsy experience. I bet they had a lot to get their jollies too"
"Sometimes one gives priority to work	The world is very beautiful	I do agree, I would even say most of the earth is!"
"Exactly. Look at the beautiful scenery around you. Nature at its very best. I am surprised people don't notice	I agree.  People don't realize it because we don't see them doing anything to actually change the surroundings or improve things."
"People are getting busy everyday with other stuff and they forget to breathe fresh air. Leads to s stressful life	I can remember feeling so disillusioned when someone who I really admired as a visionary turned out to be a real jerk on a day-to-day basis.	Yea, that's always tough when you look back on someone and see how they acted that specific time period. It makes it hard to value them as people who have done a great job of distancing themselves from those people and moving in with a set of values they held."
"Well, it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal. Not really fair to them *or* to yourself, is it?	Sometimes I have the feeling that I am the worst kind of person to someone else."
"As a kid, I was SO frightened any time there was a tornado warning. Not sure if it was the Wizard of Oz effect or what -- I just remember being frozen with fear.	Tornados give me the creeps too! We had a house burned down due to a tornado! I always had to stay with the kids and scare them until we caught the tornado lol"
"That's the thing -- NO! I mean, there were some that were kind of close -- but NOTHING like what so many folks have to deal with. I just remember wanting a basement sooooo badly -- not something that's common where I grew up!	I grew up in michigan and there was one tornado every year. People talked me into moving somewhere warm like hawaii."
"My mom said the best thing once when I was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and I didn't want my own fear to affect the little boy I was with -- she was on the phone and just said ""You have big plans for the future, right? Nothing is going to get in the way of that."" For some reason, it worked a charm ;-)	I am glad that it worked out for you"
"I feel so bad when I think back to times that I got angry and yelled at my kids for no real good reason -- just a combination of the day's events and feeling irritated, really.	I know exactly what you mean. I used to get super mad when I was the same way as well, only it was with my older sister's kids."
"Yes! THAT I feel good about! Making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk. I've definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act -- emphasizing that it's not about *them*, it's really about the person and where they're at.	That is good.  It's easy to become a little overbearing when kids are little and become like a pet."
"I do look at that as a strength, in anyone. Being able to say ""I'm sorry"" and ""I made a mistake.""	I was SO excited the first time we were going to make an overseas move! I looked so forward to what I knew would be a life-changing adventure!	I bet! Where did you guys end up moving too?"
"I highly, highly recommend it. Not always easy -- culture shock *is* a thing! -- but such a great way to enhance one's perspective.	Yay! where to!"
"i would fear my gift	What is it that you fear the most"
"my partner gave me a an i phone it is very memorable and pleasure to me	I'm glad you enjoyed it!"
"yes but its a valuable gift to me	What kind is it? I have an old iPhone5.4"
"yeah but this gift is definitely different for me	I have such an amazing husband! He works so hard so i could stay home with our baby	That is awesome. My parents had that problem."
"he is an armed guard	That is an incredible blessing."
"I have a pretty bad vision so i'm so scared to drive at night	Have you ever been in a car accident?"
"yes, i even have glasses but because of astigmatism i don't see good at night even when i have glasses on	I am sorry you have that fear"
"It seems like today everyone in the grocery store was in such a rush. Hurrying around!	That's a great way of putting it! I hate when people drive so fast."
"Yes! They cut in front, and bump into you. Plus being rude while they do it	That sounds horrible! I never in my life have I ever seen someone do something like that. Everyone just stood still and their faces said hello."
"I'm so sleep deprived and my baby wanted to play in the middle of the night and i just yelled at him :( i feel so terrible	hahaha I bet it didn;t last long though"
"i love being a mother but sleep deprivation is so horrible	Maybe you should take an epidmerge?"
"I love being around them and it's great to see them each year.	Do you get emotional about them"
"O I'm sorry, my niece and nephews, only seem in the summer. Do you get company during the summer?	They are called nephew and niece because the youngest son is nephew and the mother daughter is niece. How about you?"
"My kids are going into 7th and 8th grade in a couple weeks. They really are growing up well	That's wonderful!  I remember when my daughter was 3 and 5.  I love when they're excited and exploring the world!  What do you like to do for fun during those years?"
"My oldest daughter has some learning disabilities so I'm really proud of how she is doing. They're both growing up so fast	That is awesome! I bet your excited to see them grow up too!"
"i paid all my bills today, i feel so relived and good	That's great! It's hard to do that sometimes!"
"rent and electricity. we've been struggling financially so it's such a relieve to pay bills	I know what you mean, I struggled with money before as well."
"I studied so hard for my bar exam so that I could become a lawyer. I prepared for almost 3 months straight!	Oh wow. Sounds like a lot of studying. Did it work out well?"
"I did pass! It was a rough 3 months, but once I got there, I felt like I was ready.	That's awesome! Hardwork pays"
"I was about to book a flight for my baby and i and i was so surprised to find out i didn't need to pay for my baby'sticket	That is so wonderful! I have two little boys and they were just over a month apart when they came out, I could not have been happier!"
"i know! now i can spend the rest of the money on something cool	That's awesome, baby tickets are really cheap!"
"my husband called me a punk today for no reason. and then when i told him he hurt my feelings he didn't even understand why	That is so mean. Why would he hurt your feelings?"
"no.. i love him. but he can be such a punk sometimes	Sometimes husbands can get a way to do things that are not in their best best interest. It's really quite funny."
"When I was younger, I got my driver's license. I was sooo scared to drive, because i didn't want to get into an accident.	Driving overpasses is very scary, I feel like I was one of the drivers that got into accidents. Nowadays everyone fears getting into an accident."
"I tried to tell myself that, but my dad got into a really bad accident once, and it has scared me ever since.	That is terrible to hear. I am really glad you are okay now (I think)"
"I recently started learning to propagate my tomato plants by planting clipped off branches.	Wow! That is very creative and original!! I think I would start something like that!!"
"Yea, i put them in a glass of water for a week or two and they grow their own roots, wasn't expecting much.	Wow that's quite an accomplishment! You must be quite proud of yourself!"
"I do yes! and since the method i used is working, i have tons of tomatoes!	How many do you have?"
"Around town it seems like traffic has been horrible lately. Driving around town is just crazy.	Yeah traffic seems to always be bad here. Any specific streets you've noticed this?"
"Yes, exactly! They are always speeding or cutting you off. And of course no blinker use!	That sounds so annoying. Are you in a rush to somewhere you need to go?"
"A few years ago, I became friends with someone through an online video game. Eventually we trusted each other, so we met up in person!	That's cool!  What kind of video game was it?"
"I'd say it's going pretty well, we eventually got married! How did you meet your friends?	Through an internet videogame? I didnt even know there were any videogames out right now. What game did you all play?"
"OKay. I care for everyone	You sound like a nice person"
"Thanks, I hope I am. You sound like one too	I care for everyone because I love them and want to give them everything"
"because you gave me a compliment, which I feel is a genuine one	I recently had a one night stand with a woman from my past. It caught both of us off guard	That's interesting, are you guys together?"
"Yes, it was a very interesting time. I wish to continue talking to her despite living in different locations	Wow, how interesting! How did she respond to the situation?"
"My wife was able to get a job with Microsoft without going to a four-year college!	Wow! What a great accomplishment. That's amazing!"
"She really is. It just shows that you don't need to have a four-year degree in order to be successful.	That is so awesome!"
"I walked my dog outside, and she still pooped in the house! Ugh.	That's annoying! Did you give her a bath or was she just exploring her territory?"
"Yeah...Even though I take her outside, 10 minutes later, she'll poop or pee in the house. Why!?	That is infuriating! I guess she didn't have enough toilet paper :("
"I think being with my husband makes me a better person	Being with someone makes you more enjoyable."
"Definetly, he's my best friend forever.	That's awesome! How long have you been together?"
"I really don't like when things happen when noone is home.	I totally understand that feeling! I get home sick all the time and it's the worst."
"Like stuff falling off shelfes because a dog runs into them! Hah, crazy I know.	Yeah that is annoying.  Things that happen when no one is around are even worst when it's convenient to just watch tv or do stuff at home."
"I really love my life right now.	thats great to hear"
"Nothing really! I just love that I can work at home and have time to clean or cook whenever I want.	I love being home too! I am glad you are happy!"
"Right? And no having to interact with others unless we choose too.	Yea, I wish I could be the same! I'm currently on leave and am kind of bored at home.  Maybe I'll finally get a day off where I can come home to just kick back for a while and just relax."
"So i just got home and all of my friends were there for a birthday party i have no clue! can you imagine my reaction?	I can imagine! Where were they all from."
"Well the party was for me, hahaha they really got me on that one!	You are very lucky! I hope you had a good time at the party!"
"Its not fun being reminded of things you've forgotten.	I can imagine so.  Do you have fond memories of it?"
"Owed money to my mother in law for something, $15, she reminded me in a less then nice way.	That's sad but I guess you'll get to make it up to her"
"Exactly, especially since she owes me a lot more of something being paid over time.	I went to San Antonio the other day, was great to see that city.	That sounds like fun! What did you guys see on the trip? Did you go on many adventures?"
"O really? What's your favorite thing there?	That is cool! I live in New York now but before that I lived in New York City. It has been a while since I have visited San Antonio. What did you do there that made you like it so much?"
"I just got back from my graduation! can you imagine after 5 years i graduated with the highest score of my college in the past 20 years!	Congratulations on that! You have worked very hard."
"Yes! i studied so hard, can you imagine how i feel? i cannot believe it!	Congrats! That's amazing, I bet your mind was blown."
"I hate the sight of someone throwing up. My nephew did that the other and day and man.	I am sorry about that. Did you do anything about it>"
"Yea, he had eaten to much sugar and well, it didn't end well	Oh no, that's awful! Did you end up taking him to a doctor's to have him removed from his diet?"
"I came home from work and step barefoot on one of my sons legos, i was so pissed!	Oh no! How'd he react?"
"Yes, i was so mad i always tell them to pick the toys up.	That's really frustrating! I hate when my kids are out of place"
"My mother in law got to eat Qdoba today, one of my favorite places I haven't had in awhile	That is awesome. I haven't been to quebelitas in a long time."
"No way. queso all the way! They don't have one near by but she was traveling and the airport up north did.	QDoba is awesome! You must have been chompy after that one."
"Yesterday i watch on tv a kid who could speak 4 different languages at age 3, i was in shook!	That's so cool, I'm glad he was successful."
"Well they are called wonder kids! i was in wonder, i also read about one who just graduated from college at age 11	that's so cool! what was the kid's first language? that's so amazing, i can't even imagine"
"My husband is quite impressive to me.	What sort of impresses you about him?"
"Yea, he's become the best manager in his market in just 3 years.	Wow! That's amazing! What market is it?"
"This afternoon i went to my sons soccer game and he scored three goals! happiest dad ever!	You must've been so proud! What a young athelete!"
"Yes! i love him so dad, but i feel like my own achievement since i teach him how to play, he dedicated the three goals to me!	That's awesome! You must have felt so proud of him."
"I was doing a presentation for work, and tried to tell a story about something kind of related to break the ice.  No one laughed or even really cracked a smile, so it put me off for the rest of the presentation.	That's a shame, I imagine that's a painful and nerve wracking position. Do you get used to being put in that position by others?"
"Yeah, and I really thought it was a decent story.  Nothing ground breaking, but at least should have gotten a chuckle.	That's okay, everyone has those moments in their lives. It was a good story in and of itself."
"My wife went to Germany to attend a language course at the end of June.  I've been mostly spending time with my dogs while she's been gone since we recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	Oh, do you feel lonely there?  I can't imagine!"
"That's a good idea.  I don't know where there's a dog park near me, I should look into that.	That is a great idea! I have two dogs, they love to run around and have fun!"
"Something I did not expect from a neighbor, this morning he gave me some beautiful flowers	That's so sweet! What kind of flowers?"
"It was a nice gesture on his part. But I do not know	Oh wow, flowers are always a pleasant surprise! What did you do with them?"
"But beyond that. Small gestures make others' lives happier	My neighbor has a really annoying little dog that she always brings outside when she's smoking.  It barks constantly at everything and she doesn't try to keep it quiet.	That is so annoying, have you spoken to her about it?"
"A Pomeranian.  I don't have anything against that type of dog specifically, but this one is just terrible.	That's a hard one, I have two dogs and can say for sure they bark more at loud noises (like cars moving)"
"This morning my husband received a call, he got nervous, I think it was a woman ... difficult	What did she say to him when he answered the phone"
"I think so ... I'm a little worried, because of the situation	What situation are you in right now.  I hope everything is okay."
"Thank you for your solidarity	I have a great picture from my wedding where my friends and I are in a circle having a shot, makes me want to go hang out with them again.	That's really cool!  Did you guys get to do it a lot back in the day?"
"Yeah, we moved away a few months after the wedding for my wife to go to Graduate school.	that's so sweet!!! are you and your wife still very close?"
"Yesterday, a difficult day, the anniversary of the death of my mother	Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that, I have lost all of my mother's in a nursing home."
"Thank you for your solidarity	I am sorry for the difficulties. I have lost many mother's before. It's important that we remember their lives in their best light"
"seven years .... I miss her	I went for an interview for a job I really wanted and ended up waiting a long time before I heard anything.  I managed to keep my spirits up for a good long while.	It's good you were patient. In my industry, you wait forever for a call! It can make all of the difference between getting an offer and not getting an interview"
"I did actually!  It's a good job, especially since the market where I am isn't great for my field.	That is awesome, what is the job?"
"My daughter is angry with me, she says she does not need me, because I scolded her	Oh, no. Scold her? How come?"
"She is 9 years old but she is a very focused girl	Wow!  You can't really blame her though.  Sounds like you have a very hands off approach to dealing with her"
"that's right ... but I think I've surpassed	Hello, tomorrow I have the cooking test and I feel safe. I am sure that I will approve with an excellent rating	That sounds great, good luck!  I am sure that you have prepared very well"
"have my own restaurant	That sounds great!  Is it a new place?"
"with work, effort and clarity in the goal ... I will surely arrive	I'm so happy i made enough money yesterday to pay my bills!	That's awesome! I'm happy for you!"
"yes, such a relieve!	That's great. Yes such reliefs can be life savers especially when dealing with a lot."
"Sometimes we have angels, called friends, I'm happy because God sent me mine	That is a great blessing."
"We are 12 years old, but we have had difficult moments, but we have overcome it	Thats good, it helps us grow"
"That's right ... I'm happy	my son behaved badly with his friend, I treat him badly, I had to punish him	That sounds rough, I'm glad he's better now!"
"He is 12 years old, but he must understand that friendship is something sacred	That's really rough. I have two daughters myself. I have never had any sort of issue when it comes to their friendships."
"he hit him and said a bad word	When my brother got out of college he had a job and a car and was doing so fucking great for himself. Everything was lined up and he was ready to take off in the world. The moment I graduated college I have nothing that I can do. I took the same degree but that 5 year gap has led me to have nothing compared to him. It was so fucking annoying	I'm sorry you had to experience that."
"I do my best but sometimes that's super hard. I guess that's just one of those things everyone got to deal with.	I am so sorry. That is one the biggest pains of life. I am sure you have been through worse but its nothing to complain about and deal with. Life is just unfair all around."
"You too, thank you!	I went to a job interview a few days ago, and I feel like I totally rocked it!	That's awesome! You must feel really confident about yourself!"
"Thanks a bunch! It pays much better than my current job, so I really hope I do, but I think I got it in the bag.	Great! I hope you get it too! What kind of job did you apply for?"
"I went through some of my old stuff yesterday, and I found my security blanket that I used when I was a kid!	That is awesome!  Did you feel sentimental about it>"
"It really did. It kinda made me sad, because it was all tattered and dirty. I ended up washing it.	That is sad to here, but it is good you found it"
"You know, I see all the back to school shopping and I think parents have their priorities mixed up.	Right, I remember when I was shopping for a car for myself and all I got was this lousy dress."
"Parents are more worried about appearances than learning. It's about school supplies not new Jordans or under armor.	Right, I wish I had money to drop"
"I found a poor stray kitten on the side of the road, and I nursed him back to full health. Poor thing.	That's so kind of you! Poor animals deserve all of our love"
"I did! His name is Alphy.	That's an interesting first name! And an awesome thing to do, too."
"It's hard as a parent, when your kids are teenagers and have to handle their own problems	Yes that is definitely true for some parents"
"I know, they mommy in me wants to just jump in and fix it all like I used to	That's no good, I feel sorry that happened."
"My wife called me this morning and told me she scored a new job with Microsoft!	Congrats! That's great news!"
"She is so excited. She's even making more than I am.	That's awesome, congrats on the good news!"
"I felt bad my dogs ears have been bothering him. We had to finally take him to the vet yesterday.	Oh no. That's awful, what did they find?"
"Yeah, it was ear mites and he got medicine for it. You can tell he isn't feeling good from side effects so I've been babying him.	Ouch, that sucks. I hope he feels better soon."
"I bought a chocolate bar for my wife at the store, and I was going to give it to her, but I ended up eating it...I feel bad.	Well, it wasn't your fault at least"
"lol I didn't tell her...Should i?	I think so.  It may make her want to change her ways.  It wouldn't be the worst thing to do."
"Don't you hate it when you get in trouble for something you didn't do? My boss got mad at me for someone else's mistake.	That's the worst. I've had that happen to me before as well. What did you do?"
"Yeah, that's the worst part. They warned me that I was going to get yelled at because of something they did.	Oh no! That's the worst.  I hope you didn't get fired, or disciplined, or both!"
"I'm taking a vacation and going on a cruise to Alaska next week!	Wow! That's amazing. I've always wanted to go on a cruise!"
"I've never been, so it's going to be an amazing experience. I'm a little nervous that I'll get seasick.	I am sure you will be fine! I am sure it it very hot and humid where you are."
"Hello, I think I will not forget the beauty of her hair, the sweetness of her lips and the clarity of her eyes	That sounds lovely!  You seemrom lovely!"
"she died ... my mother	Who is mom?"
"It is true...	Hello, I never imagined the violence that can unleash a dog attacking a bird ... I was impressed	What kind of dog is it and how is it doing?"
"in a big dog ... in the park	What does a dog do that would agreat a bird, if you mind me asking."
"I did not have the strength to control it	My poor neighboor is suffeing a lot without her husband	That's so sad.  I hope things are working out for her"
"He passed away from cancer.	I'm so sorry to hear about your animals.  I hope you can find some support from family and friends"
"I enjoyed my day the other day, found out something good! Newphew may come to live with us for ayear.	That's awesome! Congratulations! I'm happy for you and the newphew! :) How long has it been since you have seen your loved one?"
"11, he wants to see us for more then 2 weeks a year.	That's a long time!  How did you find out he was coming?"
"I lost something of my mother in laws the other day, I feel so bad.	I hope it's not too expensive to have looked"
"I'll have to buy her another piece of tupperwear, it seems silly but it's expensive stuff!	Ah that's a bummer! I know what you mean. Well I'm sure you can replace that piece as it's quite old and she won't remember anything you lost it for."
"I may do that!	I was waiting to see if i was going to receive an award	award for what?"
"Its an award due to achieving my work I have worked hard for	It's nice you were patient and got it!"
"I appreciate that. Thank you	Wow! Congrats on your new job! I can understand why you are apprehensive, but it sounds like a good opportunity.	Thank you! I agree, I think it's a great one!"
"No problem! Everything will work out in the end. No need to worry.	Thank you so much! Yes, I am very apprehensive. I think I am just nervous!"
"I felt sooooo nervous going to my last job interview! Nerves must occur in proportion to how badly you *want* something!	Did you nail the job, though?"
"I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?	I have. They're definitely hard but it's worth it. I get paid more at the moment than I would anywhere else. So, it worked out for me. ( I don't really mind the company making me an offer, it's up to the person doing the interview)"
"It just means you're in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company. To me, that helps it feel more like a conversation -- and it's more time efficient too!	I know I'm not a perfect parent but some just aren't good at it or don't care.	I think that's true in every family.  It's hard to put an ideal face on it, but it's always good to have some room to improve.  How old are your kids?"
"It is when it comes to all the unexpected stuff. Went to the mall today and lady was letting her toddler run all over the mall smelling like a dirty litter box. It smelled horrible.	That's awful, but I can't imagine she was all that disgusted by it, though."
"I always feel like no one hears me. Like When I speak it falls on deaf ears.	I am sorry you have to deal with that"
"Well, for the most part it's my family. My husband, kids and pets. I know they're not deaf and it's frustrating!	I am sorry to hear that! I have the same feeling for my kids. I am always talking at my kids super loudly trying not to slip away!"
"My daughter is a teenager now so we don't spend as much time together as we used to.	That's a shame, it's nice to spend more time with your daughter though"
"Yeah, luckily we had a fun girls evening out today. We went out to eat and did a bunch of shopping.	That is awesome. As a teenager us adults spend a lot of time with little girls."
"I'm really looking forward to this trip I have planned next week.	Where are you guys going?"
"I'm going to visit the national parks in california... well the ones not on fire.	That is exciting! I love national parks! Are you going alone or with friends?"
"I was bathing my dog in the backyard this weekend, and she got loose. She then went and rolled in the dirt getting extra filthy.	Wow, she must of got tired. I am sorry."
"It WAS. Since she was wet, the dirt got stuck inside her fur. She was even harder to clean the second time around.	Oh no! I hate that! It's so frustrating! How long did you have to clean for? I'm glad you didn't lose her."
"Been having a good day, relaxing on my couch watching Netflix. I got a nice cup of hot chocolate and my cat curled up in my lap.	A cat needs a place to cozmose, have an up vote"
"Yeah, it's been a great day. Thinking about moving to the bed and going to sleep next.	That sounds wonderful!  What are your plans afterwards?"
"I had a job interview yesterday. I was really nervous before it started.	Oh, good luck on it. Did they have enough people for your team to handle it?"
"It was in person. We mostly interviewed in a conference room, then we took a lab tour afterwards.	How do you feel about it now that the interview is over?"
"i am very faithful	That is good, do you love your partner very much?"
"yes my behavior refereed to people	ok"
"thank you	Thank you who?"
"nothing	Thank you for nothing."
"thank you	You're quite welcome"
"nothing	Thank you for nothing."
"i am going to garden	That sounds very fun! I love going to the garden."
"thank you	Oh, I have never tried that, I had heard of people growing potatoes though."
"It was bad and ontop of it they refused to admit their mistake	What was the mistake?"
"placed an order online and the appliance place didnt have it, so they gave me something else without telling me	That is bad service."
"Thanks for hearing me out. I filed a complaint at the council. I hope they listen	That's a good thing you filed. You're being treated unfairly."
"I really was distraught	What happened?"
"yes. Makes me value human-human interaction a lot more. I had to go to the grocery store to feel ok	oh no. what happen?"
"it made me proud he was my rep	What made him your rep."
"the president represented us at this association	That's really cool! What other things does your dad do?"
"International Ceramic trading	It has been very quiet in here since she went on vacation. No one to talk to.	Who is she? Someone you know or just someone you're forgetting?"
"I kept myself occupied with movies and video games. But it wasn't the same as having real company.	i can understand that"
"I can't wait to travel south to get my favorite take out. Can't find it here.	What's your favorite take out?"
"About an hour. But it'll be worth it.	What is your favorite restaurant to eat at in town?"
"I'm quite happy with where I live. I have 3 swimming pools to use anytime I want and also a gym.	That sounds great.  Do you have any animals?"
"Yes but there's hardly anyone else who uses them because they only come for 2 weeks out of the year for a vacation. I'm here permanently.	Wow. That's pretty rare. Are you a really big town?"
"I have never been so shocked than when my husband threw me a birthday party without me knowing.	That sounds amazing! Were you shocked that he did such a great job?"
"It was so much fun. I thought is was going to be another normal day. Wake up, go to work, etc. but I was wrong about that!	Wow! I bet that brought back a lot of memories for the both of you! What a day that was! Cake or pie?"
"Yes, last week. Thank you!	It was a long 3 weeks but I'm so happy it's over and she's back now	Good for you!  Did everything work out?"
"She went to visit her family	Thats good news! Do you have any plans after this?"
"It was a very hard experience in my soul to lose my mother	I'm sorry to heard that. Losing a loved one is always tough but it gets easier as time goes on."
"Thank you for your solidarity	I'm so sorry to hear about your mother's struggle. Losing a loved one to a health issue is always hard, but treasure those that have lost all through life. Treasure the journey that you have made in light of your memories and the journey that you are on now. treasure that journey always make it count."
"thanks	We knew she was pregnant, but didn't know the gender yet. Imagine my shock when I saw the ultrasound for the gender!	wow that's so exciting! is she a girl or boy?"
"Well it's a boy. Which is what I have been wanting since we met	Awe. Thats awesome. I love kids."
"Even though there are plenty of flirts around, I remain loyal to my wife.	Same here, I think it's important for couples not to take each other for granted"
"It is the most important thing to me. I have told her since day one, which was 5 years ago now.	That's great! I hope your wife feels the same!"
"My friend got a new truck, I'm really envious of him.	How nice is the truck that he just got?"
"I agree, if I work hard I could buy that truck.	What truck did he get?"
"I should, I just need the drive to get out there and do it. I need to stop wasting money.	Hello, I feel that today is going to be a wonderful day .... I will enjoy it	Great! What makes you feel that way?"
"If I really like to be positive, despite the difficulties	That sounds wonderful! It's good you feel that way, that's a good way of looking at things I think. I'm glad that it sounds like you have something exciting happening!"
"so it is ... a big hug	I have been looking after my wife this week. She has the flu	That's good of you. Is she better now?"
"It seems so. Sleeping all day today lol	That's a bummer. I hope she starts to feel better."
"This morning and I saw a tree, I never detailed it, but this time I saw it beautiful ... I realized God exists	I'm glad you got a good look at it"
"I gave thanks in spite of the difficulties	Wow, that's so deep and thoughtful!"
"thank you for your comments	Today I realized that my daughter sings wonderful, I enjoy it a lot ... I was impressed	That's awesome! You must be so proud!"
"she is 9 years old ... she is a nice girl	Thats awesome! Does she sing well too?"
"that's right ... thanks for your comment	Hi, I feel bad because I've realized that I do not love my husband, but I do not have the courage to tell him	Oh that sucks, but you can't help who they fall in love with. It is their life."
"You're right	its okay to admit it. but dont rush it. I have been there before."
"thanks	I'm looking for a new job, and I'm feeling pretty good about my options.	That's good! What kind of job is it? Are you qualified?"
"There's a lot of openings for tech jobs lately, especially technical support.	That's good, I'm in education and there's a ton of demand for IT workers. I hope you land that position."
"My wife just went out of town for school for 2 months.  I don't really know anyone here, so I don't know what I'm going to do while she's gone.	Maybe try and find something to do in your free time?  Or join clubs or get hobbies!"
"I'm sure it is great for her, but it makes me feel a little unsure of what to do with myself.	A little downtime is good for everyone. It will help her grow in your life."
"Hello, I made a serious mistake. I made a comment without bad intentions of the elders. I related them to the dinosaurs, and my father heard it ... he looked me in the eyes ... and he told me that you too could be one of them ... I felt bad	That sounds like a conversation you had with your father. I am happy it was resolved and not you two making it worse."
"yes, but I feel like a cockroach	Oh my, what did he tell you?"
"thanks	I'm supposed to be on a diet, but I couldn't help myself and I ate three chocolate bars.	hahaha oh no, were you hungry?"
"But I'm supposed to be on a diet! I can't lose weight if I have no self control :(	hahaha I hear ya there...I have been eating a healthy diet like for 3 years and never went on a diet..went on vacation once and had a massive craving for chocolate but couldn't help myself"
"my husband lost his job a couple of months ago and yesterday he finally got a new job!!	Oh wow! That must be so stressful! What did you guys do?"
"He is such a hard working man! He works so much so i could stay home with our baby	That's great! I know it's hard when your hardworking and have kids but it's so great when your hardworking and don't have to support them!"
"I was trying to take a nap the other day and my neighbor wouldn't shut her tiny barky dog up.	Haha!  That is funny!  What did you do?"
"Ugh, that's the worst.  Thankfully we're on the second floor so we don't have to deal with car noise too much.	That must have annoyed you. I am glad you have neighbors like that to make things easier on you."
"I lost my favorite hoodie somewhere. I'm so upset. Like how could i lose a hoodie? it's so big, did i just leave it somewhere?	Maybe you should buy a new one? You can also use the money you'd get from sales tax to buy a new one!"
"I've been to so many places on that day it would be really hard to do it	i know how you feel, i have lost several my size"
"I'm going to see my parents in 3 weeks!! I didn't see them since 2014! I'm so excited	That's awesome! I wish I had parents to see my parents. I'm a college freshman."
"no, with my little baby. they've never met my son, they can't wait	wow, you must really miss them. I hope it will go as planned"
"My wife had been out of the country for 2 months for school.  I left early to get to the airport to get her when she came back because I was excited to see her.	Oh wow. How long has she been away?  Did you enjoy your time with her?"
"Yeah, it's especially long since we only recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	It's good that you went, though. Are you studying abroad?"
"I wish my neighbors were more considerate. They woke me up at 4am recently.	Oh wow! Sorry about that, did they realize you were upset? I hope they didn't yell at you!"
"No point. Their smoke alarm went off and management don't care anyway.	That's crazy, I would wake you up if my neighbors did that too! I hope they learned something"
"Me too! I really don't appreciate their lack of manners - it's as if they own the whole complex!	my friend came over yea=sterday and we were sitting on the couch chit chatting and when i got up i accidentally farted. so embarrasing	Oh my, that must have been quite an uncomfortable moment for both of you. Was it the first time they had ever heard it?"
"she did, she didn't say anything but i know she heard it	Oh no! That's pretty embarrassing! Were either of them loud enough to notice?"
"My girlfriend went on a week trip with her friends, and left me alone to fend for myself.	Where did she fly off to? Is she coming back with friends?"
"Mostly been playing video games, but it's so boring without her.	Aww, that's really sweet and lucky for you! You deserve to be with someone special!"
"Hello ... I give thanks for the good things and the things that do not, the good things make me feel good and the satisfaction and the bad things are internal growth	so you are saying your life is good right now. That's good"
"For me it was a hard learning ... but after many blows ... I assimilated it	That is great that you took the difficult step and have been able to do it.  You have a good story to tell!"
"for a year ... you assimilate it when you realize that you are responsible ... neither the people nor the circumstances are responsible	That's great that you finally got over that difficult gate!"
"condition the mind and spirit	I am so glad it worked out that well for you. What have you achieved so far"
"I lost my mother to breast cancer several years ago and I am still grieving the loss.	Oh, I'm so sorry! Losing a family member is always so hard, I can only imagine."
"yes, I talk about it but it really does not help much. I pray a lot and that gives me some comfort	I'm so sorry you're going through that, it can't be easy. How old was she when she passed?"
"I dont have a pastor, or a church I can go to. I meditate and I pray and I watch preachers on Sunday morning tv. All of those do help some.	I had plans to move from Florida to California, but I'm starting to get cold feet...	why is that? is it too expensive there?"
"Ohh! Did you change your mind? I'm trying to convince myself that it's going to be better for me to make the move.	You can't go both ways... But I'm glad you are trying. It can be tough to say goodbye to someone you love and see them every now and then. But you will be happy in the end!"
"today I think today is a day to learn, to hug, to smile, to make someone happy	wow thats a great idea, I'm glad someone said something positive!  Do you have any day plans?"
"that's right ... but I dedicate an hour to do that, to my children I kiss them, my neighbor smiled at him and from life I try to learn something	wow. That is great"
"It makes me feel good that my reflection serves you ... I send you a smile	I'm so lonely. I mean... i have no friends, no husband, no kids. i wish i had at least somebody in my life	I am so sorry to hear that... I am here for you if you want someone."
"not really. i love playing video games and watch tv. i'm socially awkward	I know what you mean, i dont have any friends either"
"My wife has been out of the country for almost 2 months.  I can't wait to go pick her up at the airport!	Where has she been. Must be nice to be alone for a whole year"
"I'm assuming you got cut off somehow :P  I'm very happy she's coming back.	Oh no, when did she leave?"
"Germany for a language immersion course.	I am so thrilled to be able to go on a short but long overdue vacation	That's awesome. Where will you be going?"
"A short weekend trip to the ozarks for a float trip on spring fed white water.	That sounds really fun. I have never been to the Ozarks before! I bet it is gorgeous!"
"Down close to the border line of arkansas and the ozarks. It is around the current river	I was planning my wedding and trying to get a caterer.  The one we were looking at was completely ignoring every time my wife tried to communicate with them, to the point where I told them off and went with someone else.	That sounds terrible. I'm so sorry you had to go through that!"
"Yeah, it was weird, the caterer was a woman so I can't imagine it was like a sexism thing, but she responded to me almost instantly every time.	That's really strange, since a woman's job is to communicate to and get information."
"I got a free pizza from Domino's but felt bad about how it happened.	Did it really happen?"
"The pizza took forever to get delivered so I asked if it was free.  The delivery girl, who was brand new, didn't know so she just didn't charge me.	Wow. What pizza did you end up getting?"
"Well, I like free pizza for sure. But I still felt a bit concerned that they might take the cost of it out of her paycheck.	how was your day?	It was pretty good. Did you have a nice day?"
"yeah good. whats your name?	I hope yours was good too. My name is James. What about yours?"
"oh its fine nice to chat with you unknown friend	hello how was your day?	It was okay. How was yours?"
"yeah fine great day	I hope it was a nice day for you! Did anything special happen?"
"yeah nice to talk to you.	I wore wrong pair of socks to the college. But, no was there to spot it. But, when we have to go in for a church we have to first remove the shoes. At, that time friend of mine spotted with with wrong pair of shoes. They made a fun of me. That was very awkward situation.	That sounds like a situation you must have been rather embarrassed about."
"My room was messy as there was a party last night in my house and friends were enjoying in whole house. That is the reason.	That's funny, I had something similar happen at my old job."
"ohh	I went for a job interview, and it seemed to go pretty well.	Oh nice, how do you feel about that?"
"It should be a couple weeks, assuming they go at the pace they said they would.	How do you feel about that?"
"I moved far away from my hometown for the first time so my wife could go to grad school.  It's hard to be away from my friends.	grad school is so much fun though!"
"Yeah, definitely, that's why I went ahead with the move.  I'm just not very good at meeting people, so it can be tough.	It's really tough. Even though you're far away from your loved one, you're still spending time with them. Maybe it will push you to having more friends in the area you want to move to, or to having more hobbies, etc."
"I took my wife to the airport for her trip out of the country for 2 months.  I felt really bad on the way home.	Where did she go?"
"Mostly work and hang out with the dogs.  We just moved recently and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	That is sad, maybe she can take a flight to your home."
"Germany for a language course.	I almost got in a fight in a drive-thru lineup.	Uh oh.. I hope you weren't going for a drink"
"No, the person cut in front of some other people.  I confronted him about it and we got into a shouting match.	Did the other person get in a fight back?"
"Yes, afterwards I regretted the confrontation.  I thought I could have easily been shot.	I got on a stranger's boat by accident at the marina.	Oh no! How did that happen??"
"Fortunately the owner didn't see me before I got off, but I sure felt stupid about it.	Oh wow! That's pretty scary! How did you manage the accident?"
"Indeed.  And next time I'll be sure to double-check whose it is before I come aboard.	I was looking at old pictures from my first ""adult"" apartment, and thinking about all the times I spent there with friends and roommates.	Adult apartments seem nice, but I'm 26 and would like a change! How often do you see people there with kids, and does it get busy at all?"
"It can, but it can also hurt sometimes.  It's probably just nostalgia hardcore, but sometimes I wish I could go back to that time.	Looking at pictures is one thing, writing letters on wall papers is another. But I agree, it is difficult as an adult to move into a house that has everything.  Do you have any pictures from that apartment still?"
"Last night was crazy. I couldn't relax even though I really wanted to. I was in a house full of people screaming and yelling.	I am glad it wasn't a neighbors party!"
"My friend and her mom were fighting about money, and my friend's daughters were wanting attention.	That does sound crazy! I'm glad your night was peaceful! Did your friend calm you down?"
"I hope so too. I plan on going back to my place just to get away from all of this.	I had a job interview today and i think it really well.	Nice, do you think you will be getting it back, or no."
"The interviewer told me that I was his favorite interview so far. And I think my qualifications are a really good match for the company.	That's awesome!  Is it in the field you're least excited for?"
"I saw a picture of a dog on reddit that looked a lot like mine so I called out the person saying it was a picture of my dog, but it turned out I was wrong.  Whoops.	Aw, well that's okay. Doggos can be fun though!"
"Yeah, I don't like calling people out in general, don't know what made me think to do it this time.	Its okay, happens to the best of us"
"I'm surprised the police are going to let they get away with it.	Are the police involved?"
"I think the mailman might be mad at me because I keep ordering heavy items.	What kind of heavy items do you order usually?"
"My test results come back today. I do hope everythings ok.	I hope they help you and give you an edge."
"I had an abnormal ekg and they did a stress test on my heart to make sure everything's alright.	How'd it go?"
"Absolutely! I'm just over-worrying because I've always been so healthy. Just a little stressed out.	I went back to my home where I grew up and a flood of good memories came bavk to me. I had so many fun times with my best friends when I was a child.	That is wonderful! Did you visit a lot back then?"
"Playing outside in the summer time. Many fun summer times. Swimming holes, icecream, catching fireflies.	Those sound like wonderful times.  Do you still keep in touch with your best friends?"
"Me too!	My parents gave me a car for graduating from college. It makes my life so much easier.	That's so awesome! What kind of car? You can get a good deal online if you want"
"Thanks, now all I got to do is get a real career. I couldn't have done it with out them.	That's so awesome! What are you most excited for?"
"The more problems I have to deal with, the more faith, and faithful I become. I am stronger in my faith when bad things happen in my life and around me.	That is great! I have had problems in the past with my family as well."
"I was told once by a dear departed friend that ""what ever floats a persons boat it good because it keeps people sane as long as no one is being hurt.	That's really great that you have such a faithful friend."
"yeh to that	I had a job interview yesterday that I thought went really well, but it didn't. They just emailed me back and told me that I didn't get the job.	I'm sorry to hear that."
"I'm just pretty embarrassed, I was so confident. This whole job hunting adventure has been a complete nightmare.	I am so so sorry, I know it must be hard but you just got to keep your head up!  Are you applying anywhere else?"
"I can understand why you might be jealous of your coworker. I would try to keep your head up.	I am, I just have a lot to be jealous of."
"You said that you were envious of his promotion. It is understandable though.	I understand. Thank you. Yeah, I'm trying to be more grateful now that I'm in a more prestigious field :)"
"Okay, I am glad to hear that you are no longer feeling jealous.	I just got a puppy, but I have to leave him at home while I go to work. I feel so bad.	Pets can be good though! Take your puppy to the park and spend a lot of time together!"
"Fortunately, no. I let him run around the house, but I feel like he gets bored, so I keep the TV on for him.	Aww!  That's cute!  I would totally let my puppy run wild around the house!  He's probably just grateful that you kept him around!"
"Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.	Stealing is wrong? what would be considered stealing"
"If that is the case, I can understand why they had to do it. In circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain, then it is most definitely wrong.	I totally get what you are saying"
"My dog disappeared while I was away at college.	Oh man that's a real bummer. Did you find him?"
"My mother was walking her in a park and the dog fell down a cliff.  She was never found or recovered.	That's a bummer.  Did she at least get a little bit mauled?"
"Yes, I loved her a lot.  It took a long time to get over but it was quite a long time ago at this point.	I'm looking forward to my niece arriving from Washington. I haven't seen her in 2 years!	That's awesome.  How far away does she live from you?"
"Probably not, because she is 6 months pregnant. Her husband is in the military and is away, so she will be here when she has her baby.	That's awesome!  How exciting!  What an incredible amount of time!  How old is she?"
"Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors!	You will be okay! 6 months isn't that long!"
"Oh cool! What kind of doctor?	A general doctor.  I'm scared I may have a stroke!"
"Oh wow, you must be very proud of her. That is quite an accomplishment.	Yes, very much so! It has been quite some effort and hard work, but it's payback for not having much to work with."
"My mother just graduated from nursing school in her 50's. She put in a lot of effort, and she proved to herself and others that she could do it.	It's nice to hear that. Sounds like she's accomplished quite a lot."
"I saw a homeless guy the other day on my way home, and it made me reflect on my own life.	oh thats good"
"Lately, I've been thinking how miserable I am at my job. As terrible as it sounds, when I saw him, I thought life could be much worse.	Life always is a scary thing, that's for sure."
"A violent windstorm blew through my town and uprooted a tree in my yard.	Oh geez, I hope it didn't do too much damage!"
"No, it missed everything but the lawn. And then my neighbor was nice enough to bring over his chainsaw and help me cut it up for disposal.	That's so awesome! I wish my neighbor was nice like that!"
"I used to know someone who got incredibly famous.	Oh really?! What did they do to get so famous?"
"She's a female singer. It sort of burns me up because I feel like she doesn't deserve it and she's rather manipulative.	Who is female singer?"
"Sorry, I won't do that.  But pick the female singer you dislike the most and pretend it's her.	Years ago I used to have such a good time. I had money to spend, time to do the things I love. How I long for those times again!	I know exactly what you are saying"
"Didn't the sun always shine back then, when we were happy and young and had money?!	I think the world still has the opportunity to do a lot better honestly."
"That's true. I still like to look fondly upon the past, but the future will be bright, too.	Someone broke into my apartment last week. I was not home at the time, but now I worry that they will come back.	that is scary! is it a crackhead break in? or an aggravated one?"
"Yes, my TV was stolen. They also clogged every toilet in my apartment. I think they have just eaten Thai food.	Oh my gosh!  Those guys should be on some sort of watch list.  I hope you had someone with you that was with you the night that it happened?"
"I woke up this morning, and my mailbox had been smashed in. I think the neighborhood teens had smashed it with a bat.	Oh no!  Were you able to find out who did it?"
"I did, they are investigating currently. I hope they find the hoodlums.	I'm sure they caught those culprits!"
"I did not get the job that I had interviewed for. I thought the interview went well, but I guess not.	Oh that stinks. I'm sorry. What career field do you have in the mean time?"
"Not as of now. I have applied to a couple of other jobs.	Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that, I'm sure something will come around for you, though."
"Last week, my pants fell down in gym class. The elastic strap holding them up broke.	Oh no, were they unbreakable?"
"I ran out of the gym crying, and the whole class pointed and laughed.	Oh no. I am sorry to hear that."
"I love my cat, but she is driving me crazy constantly rubbing up against my face. I have so much cat hair in my nose.	Ugh. I hate when that happens. Have you taken her outside?"
"She keeps walking across my chest and rubs on my face as she walks across. I know she's being sweet but it tickles.	I can understand that"
"I am going on a vacation this Thursday! I am very excited!	Where will you be going?"
"We are heading to Somalia! We had some business dealings to attend to, and we will be seeing the ocean as well!	Oh, I bet that will be exciting! I've never been toSomalia. Have you been to North Korea?"
"I clogged up the toilet at a female friend's house by accident. I didn't tell them.	Oh no!  Were you able to repair it ok?"
"Yes, it is a legitimate medical condition. I have irritable bowl syndrome.	Oh no! I hope you can get the Doctor to treat you! Is there anything you can do?"
"I won a prize at an event in my college and felt very happy, proud	What was the prize?"
"It was for a chess competition.	Congratulations! How much did you win and for how long?"
"They gave a cash money of 200$. Isn't that cool? Have you won any?	I have a coworker that will not stop talking. He mostly talks about himself	You should have a listen to this man. He is interesting person"
"Yes, it is quite frustrating. I don't mind listening to people, but I would like them to ask how I am doing from time to time.	That is so annoying! Have you tried asking for a break?"
"I have been waiting on a package my friend sent me to arrive at my house. I heard a knock at the door but it was a package or my roommate.	Who was it?"
"Yeah it is. I just thought that's what it would be, so it dashed my hopes when it wasn't. I just got keep waiting, I guess.	Oh no that sounds annoying, what was in it?"
"I fell walking up the stair today. There was a large group around, and people laughed at me.	That sounds really frustrating!"
"That is good advice. I feel better about this.	That is good advice! It's important to have people who will protect and show support like that!"
"I was delighted the other day when I got to see a friend that I had not seen in 20 years.	20 years is a long time! Did you have fun?"
"It was like we just started where we left off over 20 years ago. It was like we just seen each last week, not 20 years ago.	That is a wonderful feeling. 20 yers"
"I just saw the craziest thing! A baby was riding a dog like a horse outside!	Awwww, that's really cute!  How big was the baby?"
"She couldn't have been older than one!	That's crazy! Where did it happen?"
"I was doing some freelance website work for a friend of mine and I did a lot of work for it.  Sadly, it didn't do as well as we had expected it to do, even though I put my best work and most effort into it.	Oh man, I'm so sorry! Can't you tell from the poor service that you did great?"
"It is.  We're in the process of revamping and coming up with some new and different ideas so hopefully we can do some revisions and get better results.	Oh, that's too bad. I hate when things like that happen."
"That's what I'm hoping for. It's kinda fun when you have to reach into your bag of tricks to see if anything new is there!	I'm worried that if my Aunt doesn't answer her phone, I won't be able to give her the keys so she can babysit for me this weekend.	Well that's not good at all, are you going to go in and check it out?"
"Yes, I am going on a business trip by my son has an important tennis match this weekend. I don't know what I'll do if my Aunt doesn't answer soon.	Well you should trust your son. He is an honest man"
"I am always suffering due to lack of money and I wish I could be rich someday	I'm sorry to hear that.  What is the source of all this loneliness?"
"That's good to know. No wonder we are here doing these tasks	Keep your head up. Start making your money again and after you get a bit richer you will be in a better place."
"ME TOO. MY Parents have always suffered and so have I. It is so unfair	Yeah.... Parents always have the last laugh."
"That is so true. But to lead a happy life, money is necessary to some extent.	I was really down after I found out that I was not going to be able to move.	Sorry to hear that. Why cant you move?"
"Becaue I am stuck at a mine site and no one will buy me out. No one wants to live at a mine site with land collapsing everywhere.	I'm so sorry you had to deal with that, what do you do to move?"
"I feel sorry for me too!	I am so sorry to hear that, that sounds like terrible work! Are you able to afford to get out eventually?"
"They are very helpful and I always will be faithful to them	They sound like a good bunch of guys!  What are some things they have done for you?"
"Yes, what about you? Do you feel likewise?	Yes I do. But in a different way.. I'm very trusting"
"Do you follow any particular denomination?	I'm so happy to be able to spend time with my best friend. I was not feeling good and she came over and cheered me up	I wish I had a best friend like you."
"yes, and she also helped me out and paid one of my bills when i was struggling with money	That's awesome! I bet you are very happy!"
"I saw this kid on a skateboard the other day.  I thought he was gonna wipe out hard, but he pulled off some kind of multi-flip jump thing that really shocked me.	Wow that is pretty cool!"
"I know, right?!  I tried skateboarding once when I was a kid, made it to being able to kind of not fall over in a straight line, never managed to do anything else.	Nice, skateboarding can be pretty fun. I'm not much for sports, but do you ever go to tournaments?"
"I always say i hate when other moms shame each other but guess what? i do the same thing!	What did your mom do?"
"I definitely should! I should be nicer to other moms and don't judge them	I'm not sure what you are talking about but I do agree that it is rude to shame someone for anything!"
"I love my baby so much! he is teething right now and i don't even know how to help him :(	I feel you! My girls teething and have a few hospital stays each time.  I don't think I've ever teared a baby off before! It's amazing and so painful!!"
"I know he will, i just wish i could help him. I gave him Tylenol but he was still pretty cranky	That's awful :( Have you taken any Advil yet?"
"I was walking my dogs the other day and a guy came out with his dog off leash.  The dog ran up and freaked out both my dogs.	Did you call the police?"
"Yeah, I was really worried.  My bigger dog got really protective of the smaller one, but thankfully they didn't actually get into a fight.	That's too funny! I would have been so scared! Were they alright, though."
"I just recently finished potty training my dog, that was quite the nightmare with sooo many puddles needing cleaned up.	I bet that was a relief.  Was it hard training a whole new dog?"
"I can imagine a rescue, generally being a little bit older than a fresh 8 week old someone would get, can be much harder.. It's a painful process for sure!	I can imagine it would be! I always found it easier to do this one when my girls were puppies, but I always found it easier to train them after the age of 2 or 3. How long do you have yours trained?"
"My dog started looking really sick and in pain, but I didn't have the money to take him to an emergency vet, so I had to ask my parents for a loan until I got paid.	Oh, I'm sorry! It's very hard to lose our animals, they are very loyal."
"Yeah, he's fine now.  It was some kind of stomach thing, but he got medicine and rest and is good now.	Oh no! Glad to hear he is doing better!"
"I was sitting on my back deck drinking a cup of coffee and just felt so wholesome and happy with life. It was great . You ever have any of those moments?	Yeah when i go camping or doing anything outdoor?  I haven't really had the chance to. I'm kind of introverted and introverted so it can be hard to have those moments"
"I always try to look for the small things. I got to see a hummingbird today and that was great. Anything small in your life make a big impact?	Yes I once chased a seagull in the ocean. It was a sight to see."
"Oh I can agree with that completely!	I interviewed for a job a while back that I was waiting on hearing about.  I felt like it went well.	What kind of job was it?"
"A lab manager at a university.  I've got my fingers crossed!	What kind of job is it at? Hope you get it!"
"Have you ever had to file for disability?	yes once when i was a kid. it always took me a few days to file and was always a pain to go through"
"I've had to recently. Its been really tough.	I haven't, I work too hard for it but the work doesn't always get us where we need to go"
"Do your kids ever do anything cute that turns annoying?	Not really. I turned 18 this weekend and my daughter has been acting extra childish. I guess that might be the case."
"My kids love to tell me what they are doing in their video games. It was cute at first, but you can only listen to someone talk about Stardew Valley for so long.	Haha yeah, kids love those kinds of things too. They're trying to communicate."
"I've had to help take care of others before as well.	That's nice. It can sometimes feel overwhelming caring others for things you never have control over yourself."
"Yeah, I'm not so lucky. My wifes been sick and I've been taking care of her recently.	That is hard, my wife is sick too, but she is a stay at home mom, so taking care of her is what they do best for them. I hope you guys are doing everything possible to make their day go a lot smoother!"
"I failed my driving test twice, but I was really encouraged and did better the next time.	Did you take it again?"
"I agree, I practiced and practiced and I was pleased when I passed my third time. Persistence is key.	I'm glad to hear you passed! I'm sure that motivated and motivated will get you the furthest you wanted in life!"
"I once went a restaurant, and I saw rats running around in the back kitchen!	Yikes. I don't like rat soup"
"I reported it! I was shocked and grossed out, how can a place like that operate!?	That sounds so disgusting! I hope that the food was not spoiled or that they fixed it right away!"
"Do any of your kids play any sports?	Yes, 3 does."
"My daughter skateboards. She went down the big ramp the other day. It was so cool.	I don't have any kids. But i do have 3, 6 and 10 year old kids."
"I was so late for work one day, I walked out and forgot to put on my pants!	Oh no! That is definitely something to be worried about!"
"I was so concerned about getting to work I forgot to throw them on, I was so in shock, even the neighbors saw. It was bad.	That's terrible! I hope you didn't make a habit of doing that!"
"I had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the store today. There was only one poor cashier working.	I would have been so upset! Why were there only two of you working?"
"The cashier couldn't help it. The store should hire more people.	That's so annoying! Why couldn't the cashier help herself? What was she waiting on, that's so aggravating!"
"I was so excited when I got my new puppy, it was awesome!	I love puppies what kind did you get?"
"I agree with you, the joy of adding a new member to the family is a wave of emotions, positive ones of course!	That's great! Congratulations! I have 3 dogs myself. They're all awesome!"
"Those were simpler times, I wish I could go back and relive those days!	I agree. Life can be so busy these day, it's strange."
"Childhood when you did not have so much to worry about.	I agree! I wish I could go back to just being a kid again. Life is full of wonders."
"It was great, so much time running around outside without a care in the world.	I felt like I was on the top of the world when I won the science fair in middle school. No better feeling than that for a small child.	That's amazing! What was the prize you received>"
"My project was to show what farm poop produced the most gas when it decomposed. I put the poop in a bottle with a balloon on top. Whatever balloon grew the largest, was the one that released the most gas.	That sounds amazing! How old were you? I am only 26 and I could never do that!"
"I'm sleep training my toddler, he never slept in his crib before. He is crying and it makes me feel so bad	Awwww I am glad he gets some use out of the crib. Kids are SOAT IT!"
"how did you cope with all the crying? We've been co sleeping since birth and it's breaking my heart to hear him cry	Aw, that is difficult, I had a baby 3 1/2 years and it would break my heart to have to put her to sleep. sleep training can take it out of the baby, it's very difficult! But I am glad you are doing it more often, it's very calming"
"I just got back from my vacation. We stayed at a beachfront condo and spent time there, it was so much fun! We really had a blast!	That sounds like so much fun! I love a place with a sand beach!"
"It was! We hadn't been able to go on a vacation for a couple of years, due to personal reasons, so you can imagine how we felt when we went!	Oh I feel for you. I've had family go a few years now and it's a blast! How far did you go?"
"As I look at my 21 year old son, I often reflect on when he was smaller. Time really flies!	Thats a great outlook to have."
"Yes, that's true. I still can imagine when he was waking up Christmas morning to see what Santa brought when he was 5.	Life moves fast. Julian, 27, feels the exact same way as I did when I was 5"
"I want to go on a vacation next month but now I cant.	Awwww, that sucks, why can't you take a vacation with your friend?"
"Mys husbands job sucks and they had to cancel his vacation because they arnt staffed right.	Aww that stinks.  What do yo want to go to the beach or something?"
"My son is in his last year of college! We are so excited and looking forward to graduation time!	Wow congrats! What is he going to study?"
"He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer! We are very proud of him and how dedicated he is to achieving his dream.	Wow! Congratulations! That's an amazing accomplishment! You sound like a very proud parent."
"We took our son to the doctor and luckily he is getting better!	That's good news and bad! I'm not sure what I should do but you are making the right decisions!"
"I hope so. Do you have any kids?	I don't have any kids. How old is he?"
"I went to the flea market last weekend!	How much did you get?"
"Well, kinda... I got a bunch of old Beanie Babies, haha.	Oh no! Did you end up getting anything in return for them?"
"I know! They were 25 cents each... it was crazy. They had the coolest store there with all sorts of old stuff from the 80s and 90s.	I came home the other day to find that my daughter had made all the beds in the house! She is 6.	That is such an accomplishment! How old is she?"
"haha me either most days! I was really proud of her and then she said she wanted more chore money! lol	That is pretty cool, you sound like an excellent parent."
"My aggressive pet rat attacked the baby rat and left her a horrible gash on her abdomen!	Oh my gosh!!! I would be so mad right now! What do you think would have caused the animal to do such a thing??"
"It looked so horrible. I thought for sure the baby was as good as dead.	oh no.. that is so bad. i hope she is ok"
"She's great. I gave her some medicine and she healed miraculously. It was almost unbelievable!	My mother became ill a while back and had to be put into the hospital. I was so concerned, but she became better after a few days. Such a huge relief!	That's good to hear.  Was the first week alright, or were you worried about her deteriorating further?"
"Thanks, she is. She had a blood clot in her leg and we didn't know it, so it could have been much, much worse. I can't even express how glad I was when she was better!	That's good, I hope it wasn't serious then."
"I fed a stray cat that was hanging out in my yard yesterday.	How was the cat afterwards?"
"The cat appeared very relaxed, but I could tell it was very pensive about my presence. It took some time to develop some sort of trust.	That is how I felt when giving a dog a bath or taking a dog to the dog wash. I can tell the difference if the cat is acting weird."
"One time I was camping out in the woods in California with some friends. I ended up getting lost on my way back to the camping spot in the middle of the night.	Oh no!  Were you scared at all about what could have happened?"
"If that wasn't frightening enough, I ended up getting chased by a stranger while I was looking for my camp mates!	Oh no! That sounds so terrifying! Were you able to find them?"
"I didn't force her into anything. She seemed to know what she was doing anyway	You sound like a good parent!"
"I wish it never happened now.	What did you force her into doing?"
"she was 8	I'm sorry you went through that. Was it your first experience?"
"A little while ago, my friend went on another beach vacation. It was her 3rd one for the year. My family and I hadn't been on vacation for several years, due to issues beyond our control, so I begrudged her trip a bit.	Oh I bet. That's unfortunate that you couldn't go, but I guess that's what makes it so exciting and surprising to go and experience!"
"Yes, true, I know they tend to let bills go for things like that, which I don't do.	Well at least they were honest about it."
"I am so happy it's a boy	A boy for what?>"
"He'll be here in about 3 months	Three months?! That's quick! Are yo going to meet your new best pal?"
"Hey, I just started the keto diet!	How's it going?"
"It's good so far. I was overwhelmed at first, but I rented some books from the library and got a Kindle Unlimited subscription to find some recipes and info.	That sounds great, have you used the recipes to help you in your own way?"
"Thank you, I wanted to be completely ready, so I compiled meal plans and grocery lists first.	Imagine my surprise after 6 months of trying. Now we also know it's a boy	Wow, thats a huge change, congratulations! What happened?"
"I am. Especially when we saw the ultrasound. Takes after his dad if you know what I mean haha	haha what a great surprise!"
"I just had my Sweet 16 party...	That's great! Did you invite all of your friends and family? :) Congratulations! I'm sure that brought you all kinds of stress"
"Well, about that... my dad KNEW I wanted a pink car for my birthday. But...	Did he get you the car, though?"
"A BLUE one! I'm so devastated. I don't know what to do.	I recently enrolled back in my university after dropping out 6 years ago.	Hey, congratulations!  It's awesome to have another person that cares about what they have to say!  What did you study?"
"I was scared about it at first, but so far I have all A's. I must say, I'm proud of myself!	That's great! I just graduated recently myself, so I know the feeling."
"Over the past year I've been on a weight loss journey of over 100 pounds.	Wow! That's awesome! How did you go about losing so much weight!"
"As well as exercise and diet, by far the most important thing is strong will and determination.	Wow! That's a big change!!"
"I never liked milk growing up, because my family drank skim.	Why don't you like milk growing up?"
"Well, first I tried whole milk, and that was gross. But I just tried 2% milk, and I like it!	I'm with you. I never liked the taste of milk growing up, it always tasted gross to me."
"I agree! I'm so happy I can enjoy it now.	I love skimpy milk, like skimpy cereal.  But that's just gross to me."
"No, but I am satisfied with my choice.	What was the choice?"
"I just got back from our vacation, but the drive there was so nerve wracking. There was heavy rain and traffic, and some nighttime driving. Had me on edge	I bet! The weather must've been bad!"
"Yes, well, it was just one of those things I know, but still was very tiring and can get to you after that drive.	Where did you guys vacation at?"
"Recently, I received the news about my ex boyfriend's relapse.	Oh my gosh! I hope you took the news well. Did he do it for any reason?"
"It's definitely a hard situation to take in. He had stopped using when we started dating and was off it for 2 years until we broke up. It's very discouraging.	I am sorry, that sounds hard.  Do you think he will be able to get it up?"
"On my recent vacation to Florida, there was a very long delay at the toll booths of at least 45 minutes. This was after 7 hours of driving! It was such a hassle!	I bet! It's so frustrating waiting in line at toll booths!"
"I wanted to pull my hair out lol. But, knew once we were past it, there was the beautiful ocean on the other side...finally!	Oh no! Did they repair it at least?"
"Robby got me flowers today.	That is so sweet. I bet he appreciated it very much!"
"Yes, how could you forget? It was a nice surprise, but then he said.. ""happy anniversary.""	Who forgave him flowers, that is amazing."
"Thanks, but I'm so embarrassed that I forgot!! D;	dad caught me kissing my half aunt	Where were they kissing"
"I was attracted to her. She was older. The worst part was getting hit upside the head in front of her	Oh my god. Are you alright?"
"Me found cave.	Cave found me?"
"Me am caveman. In cave was paint of cave wife. Wife hunt big mammoth.	wow, that is crazy, what color was the mammoths?"
"Me miss BC. Me miss wife.	One of the scariest, yet happiest experiences in my life was finding out that I was going to have a baby.	Oh that is wonderful news! I also had a child out of the blue. What is your favorite part of your pregnancy/"
"Oh, we were totally unprepared. In fact, my partner and I were working out of state in a compromising environment. We had to double on back home to get our lives set up for the big change!	That sounds amazing! Where were you trying to live?"
"When I was pregnant, I felt ill until it was over. The doctors were worried that something was wrong with the baby.	What ended up being the issue?"
"Usually the sickness stops within the first few months, so the fact that I fell ill so much was worrisome. Despite it all, I had a healthy, bouncing baby boy. I never have felt more grateful in my life.	That's so great to hear! I'm happy for you and the baby"
"When my dog passed away, I felt so helpless. She was old and suffering and I felt angry that there was nothing I could do other than put her down.	I can understand how you would feel helpless. It is hard to lose a pet,ud."
"She was 14. I got her when she was a puppy. Even though the situation was rough, I'm grateful for all the years we did get to spend together.	I'm sorry for how awful that sounds but at least you got a pet with a good history and life with your owner."
"I had to sit in the front while she was in the back with him	That is terrible, what did you have to eat?"
"I wanted her. But he had the money. And that's what she wanted	What did he want? A ride home?"
"My son is in college and about to return for his Junior year. We have made sure to put back ample saving to take care of his financial needs.	That's good that you are taking care of him!  What an investment!"
"We felt it was best to make sure to get ready in advance and help as much as we can. But, I know all parents aren't able to do that, or feel they shouldn't, so I can see both sides!	That's tough, but it is good that you took advantage and did what you could to help your son."
"After a long few months of being a hermit, I went out the other day to the shelter to play with some pups!	That sounds so relaxing and you must have felt really happy and joyful. I'm sorry you're having such a hard time, but I'm happy that you are having such a great time and that you're enjoying the outdoors."
"It was definitely exciting for me! I haven't been able to play with a dog since my own passed away.	I'm so happy you got to spend time with them today! My dog died a year and a half ago, but our rescue brought our puppy back to health and ended up having a surgery to repair his torn anterior cruculus. So happy for you guys!!"
"I've been feeling a bit blue and overwhelmed lately.	Why is that, is something wrong with you or someone?"
"I could definitely use one! However, I have a newborn so I'll have to wait a little while before we can go on some adventures!	I bet that is exciting though"
"These days my skin has never looked better. My diet is good, my family life is good, I've got good grades. Life is good!	That's great.  You sound very healthy!"
"Nope! I believe it is mostly due to diet and lots of water. It's amazing how much the little changes can impact.	It's almost as if people don't realize that changes can always bring about better health."
"I flew all the way to New York City to buy a designer dress for the prom.	That sounds fun! Did it rain or anything?"
"I am, thanks, but I wouldn't go there... Becky STILL managed to get the same dress as me! I am so mad!	Wow that's crazy! Did she win any awards at all?"
"I just love playing retro games. Takes me back	Me to my childhood as well! What are some titles you enjoyed most about it?"
"Oh yeah? Cool. I like the old Sega Mega Drive games. The music is just classic on those games	Those games still seem so new and fresh for me. I loved playing Gradual Stampede on the Gameboy Color"
"One night, I was home alone, when suddenly, I heard a loud BANG!	Oh my god! What was it?"
"It was a ghost! I ran into the kitchen to investigate, and I saw what looked like a white dress flapping out the window.	I'm glad someone made a funny about it!"
"Recently my daughter was voted 'Most Artistic' by her peers! She is so talented and we feel lucky to be her parents.	Thats so awesome! I really love learning and I bet that gives her such a huge boost as an artist."
"Yes, she has a natural talent, but really puts much practice and time into it.	that is amazing, what kind of an art she is making?"
"what does that mean?	nothing, just had to check my messages"
"this has obviously gone all wrong somewhere	I don't know. I think I'm just lost in my world right now!"
"5	A year ago, I found an injured baby kitten in the road while driving.	Did you take a video of the kitten? Did you report it to the animal control?"
"I cared for it myself. Now she's my beloved cat, Muffin.	That's so wonderful!  I had a feeling you did it by yourself but I didn't know you did it by yourself."
"I'm proud that she traveled across the world all by herself. 2 big suitcases and all	What an amazing feat! where did she go?"
"Wife. And she was 6 months pregnant to boot!	Wow. She must have been quite an adventurous woman!"
"There was a storm the other day, close to our home. There was a tornado warning near it, so I was afraid and nervous!	Did you go in the house"
"Yes, it luckily passed our home, but you just never know!	Thank goodness it didn't hit your home!"
"My brother recently proposed to his girlfriend, I'm really happy for him. :)	That is great! When is the wedding?"
"Yeah, he gave her my grandmothers rings, since they were nice and we had them available. He's 23 so he's trying to save money, but still wanted her to have something nice.	That's a really nice gesture. It's good for your brother that he wants to help her out by providing a little extra."
"I can't wait to get a new car soon	What kind of car are you getting"
"I want a compact SUV, like maybe something like a Toyota RAV4	Those are nice choices!  The new SUV's are really impressive and fun to drive!  Are you getting an SUV soon?  You'll be able to do just fine on the highway with ease!"
"not yet ready for the baby, need fix up his room	How old is he?"
"Not really. Haven't even started. Got 3 months to go. Yikes!	Wow! You definitely should be ready for the baby. That room is going to need some serious fixes."
"I couldn't buy my brother his gift from an online retailer that starts with an A, because apparently they don't ship to Canada from their .com website. :(	Aw man. That stinks because those are really cool looking gifts!"
"Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.	They probably don't want to raise shipping costs"
"she took me for $1600 in just 2 weeks. What a trap	Oh my, that is a lot! Do you have any idea who she is?"
"It's been 7 years and I'm still not over it	What really happened?"
"Sat here by myself for 10 days straight. Car was in the shop being repaired	Wow. What happened to it?"
"It did actually. Made me so mad. Now I have to save up again	What did you get repaired?"
"For 8 months we were led to believe we would move in to our own place. Lies	Oh, what a big lie... Did they actually move in to your place?"
"Instead her stupid grandma moved in to it!	What really happene!?"
"At the time I didn't think it was bad. But after she told me she didn't actually like it, that made me think differently	Oh, I understand where you're coming from. I can see where your coming from."
"Well she had never done it before, so I thought it was special	What made you think it was bad before?  I'm curious."
"I'm very proud of her for traveling alone at 6 months pregnant	Wow. Where did she travel to?"
"Yes. It's a boy	Where did she travel?"
"My child got sick and I had just made arrangements to go out of town on business.	Are you feeling better now?"
"I had to tell my boss I couldn't go and I was so stressed about that. It turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go.	That sucks, i hope she feels better."
"I wish I had money. Then she'd sit with me instead of him	That is sad to hear, i am sure there must be a special reason for your not have money"
"In the club	Why don't you work?"
"I don't feel bad. It's not like I made her do it. She wanted to	Ok"
"She knew what she was doing. I don't care how old she was. She knew	Well that is very sweet of you to make her feel good about herself!"
"I know I will save the money I need for the baby	That's a good plan!"
"Just to keep on working as much as I can everyday	I hope everything works out well for you!"
"I wish I never did it now. I thought it wasn't going to come out	What were you thinking?  What made you unsure?  I'm glad it did come out. What were you thinking?"
"Kinda. I thought it was a secret	What were you thinking it would come out kind of?   Are you ok?"
"it was brutal	what was?"
"i didnt shower for a few days and had an important meeting. I could tell that they could smell me. I became a tomato.	Awe!  I am so sorry!  That sounds awful."
"yes. homeless for a bit	Homeless tomorrowski?"
"i feel really bad about cheating on my girlfriend with a mutual friend.. i cant even look her in the eye	Oh no, that's awful. Did she know it was you? If she didn't know, then it wasn't so bad, right?"
"it was a one time thing.. if i tell her that would break her	Why did you decide to go through with it?"
"i was heartbroken when my dad passed away.. still not over it.	I'm so very sorry to hear that. Losing family is never an easy thing."
"5 years..	Oh no. I'm so sorry.  I can only imagine how you feel."
"i was proud to see my kid winning in painting competition.. she seems like a born artist	That's awesome! I always wanted to be an artist."
"yeah.. me and my partner are so proud of her	That's great. How old is your kid?"
"i have always felt really guilty about lying to my parents	I think we're all guilty of lying to them some how, even though we know it's bad. Why did you do it?"
"yeah, but still.. that feeling never went away	What was it about lying you were lying about?"
"i never get anxious about knowing that i am fully prepared before i go somewhere	Me too, it is very relaxing!"
"well, i guess women are more detail oriented	I'm sure there's something there."
"i feel like my girlfriend and i are soulmates.. i can never cheat on her	Isn't that the greatest feeling? Isn't it just the best to feel so loved and cherished over something that isn? - your own?"
"yeah well.. this one time this model-like girl was so close to seducing me, i escaped from there right awat	Oh man. escape is key. Did you have some escargot over the summer?"
"my dog passed away earlier this year	I am so sorry to hear about that. It is always so hard losing a pet..."
"yeah.. but its too soon i feel	That's very sad to hear. How did he die, if you don't mind me asking?"
"some guy drove past me so fast last week.. i was furious	Wow! That must have made you angry!"
"yeah.. i barely escaped!	What?! Did you honk at him?"
"1	sorry?"
"soory it was mistakenly typed.	Oh no! How did you get into that mistake?"
"how was your day?	I'm taking the California Bar exam to become an attorney in February and I'm sooo nervous!	Oh that sounds very tough! I hope you do well!"
"I played a video game when I was younger, called Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, and it made me want to become one!	Oh wow that is a big step! What will you be studying?"
"once i had been hurt by girl friend and it hurts me more than anything in my life	Why do you say that"
"yeah that really sucks.	I am sorry you had to go through that"
"I fell down at work, and my khaki pants ripped open.	Oh no! How awful!!"
"I didn't. Luckily I had a spare pair of sweatpants in my trunk. I did end up looking rather odd with a suit jacket and sweatpants.	oh damn that stinks"
"My grandpa is coming to visit!,5|5|5_5|5|5,	how exciting"
"He is coming next week! We are going to play Bingo at the local American Legion every night!	That's pretty cool. What is bingo?"
"I ate a gas station burrito for lunch. It was not very appetizing. Actually, it was absolutely horrible.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	I'm so sorry you had to experience that!"
"Yes, and now my tummy has the rumblies. My workplace bathroom is a one-seater right next to my work crush's desk. I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.	Oh my gosh. You better find something to eat then."
"how was your day?	It was pretty good. I just finished eating. What about you?"
"yeah its an another good day	Oh yea? I hope it was a great day! Was it a nice night?"

"it was windy and the wind caught my shirt.  I was like ""oops!	Oh no! How embarrassing! Did anyone see it?"
"Yes.  Luckily people around me thought it was amusing and not offensive	i have always more trust on my girlfriend	That's good. Trust is very important for any relationship."
"yeah i do. i love her a lot	Aw that is so sweet! Trusting is so important in life!"
"what about you?	I have a big exam coming up! My nerves are getting to me.	I hope it goes better than anticipated!"
"Thanks! It is my final exam for a summer class studying Database Design. I actually should be taking it right now.	Good luck! I bet it'll go fine! Are you studying for an upcoming class, or an engineering class?"
"I get to go the the zoo tomorrow! They opened an exhibit showcasing two of my favorite animal, the sloth!	Awesome! I love animals"
"They have sloths, hippos, elephants, bears!	Nice. Are you going with anyone?"
"I had a guest over that used my restroom, and they obviously have some sort of digestive issue! They didn't event tell me about it!	That would really make me mad!  I would make sure they took responsibility and covered their nasty actions!"
"Yes it is. Do you think I should confront them?	I would certainly try. They may be worried sick or are in shock that their guests are acting ill"
"i have been more happy	What made you happy?"
"happier now beacuse i have been built a new house	That is awesome! I am really happy for you!"
"Back to school time is always stressful because of how much everything costs now.	I agree, but maybe it's good to look back at the simpler things in life, like buying clothes."
"I was able to cover most of it but luckily I had a little help covering the rest of what my kids needed. Even a little help is a big deal	I am glad you were able to get help. School can really be a lot of money."

"because i built a new house	That's cool!  You must be proud!"

"My wife bought me a new watch for my birthday! She is such a sweetheart.	What kind of watch is it?"

"I just graduated from college! I feel so accomplished.	Congratulations! What are you studying?"
"I am very excited about it! Although I am a bit nervous about what is to come. I still need to find a job.	Congratulations! Thats awesome! What kind of jobs are you looking for?"

"I have, too. I actually took two classes this summer. I took an online final exam about an hour ago, and I scored the grade that I was needing. The grade I am concerned about is a Strategic Management course that I also was taking. The professor was a bit of a stickler when it came to grading.	I hope you do well on that class. Hard work always pays off."
"I recently had intercourse with somebody that I hate. I feel terrible.	That is awful, I hope you realize how much of an attraction there are to people!"
"No, I do not think I should. This person doesn't make me happy.	Wow, that seems like an awful place to be. Are you okay, or do things make you unhappy? I'm glad you were able to piece it together and come out of it stronger."
"My mom got really sick for a long time before she died. I was doing my best to see are as often as I could but I had work and lived 6 hours away.	That's terrible. How did she die? I hope it was preventable."
"The worst thing happened though. I wasn't able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off	That sucks so hard. I hope she wasn't in pain for too long. My mom was in pain for over 4 weeks before she died."
"I recently went to eat a restaurant that was not very clean. The whole place had an odd odor and made me uncomfortable.	That's disgusting! Did you complain to the manager?"
"I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning.	That is really disgusting!  I would stay far away from there next time!"
"I recently returned to my childhood home, and it brought back a flood of wonderful memories. I am feeling quite sentimental.	I bet! Did you get to play all the old games?"
"Yes, it definitely can be an emotional experience. Were/are you close with your grandparents?	Yes, I had a good relationship with them growing up. They were both very approachable."
"I was going through some boxes the other day. I found some old pictures of my kids I thought were gone	Were you looking for something in particular or just for fun? It can give you a good nostalgic feel."
"Yes, definitely! It really made us all start talking about those and other memories, good times.	Ah yes, do they make you think back to those days?"
"We had to get out of the house because of Hurricane Matthew. It was a scary experience, but luckily we'd already packed what we needed into the car, so could just leave.	I am glad you were okay. Was it bad down south?"
"Oh, you poor thing! Thankfully, we'd gassed up and were good to go. The house survived too. Were you ok?	I was fine. We did have one or two feet of snow on the ground, but it didn't really do anything for the electricity, or for us in the house, in the car."
"Ugh. We had to take the walls back to the studs, it was so bad inside. But thankfully we have wonderful friends, who accommodated us and helped with the clean-up!	I recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous.	Oh I'm sorry to hear that. What was the appointment for if you don't mind me asking?"
"It started off as a checkup, but then they requested additional testing.	I hope it went okay!"
"My neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! I couldn't believe how fast they completed the project!	That must've taken a lot of planning and construction!"
"Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse?	I have not, but I know my mom did when she was pregnant with my son!  It took a long time, but we eventually got the parts figured out and were able to build it pretty quickly!  Do you like to decorate?"
"I recently had to attend a funeral. That's never a fun day.	That's terrible, sorry for the funeral"
"Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother.	That sucks, I'm sorry."
"I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me	Wowza. What did you want to talk about?"
"I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing	Wow that sounds very unpleasant, what happened once they got to you?"
"Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!	Yea it is annoying when people act like that when you're trying to have some time to talk to you"
"I am waiting to take a big test coming up! I feel prepared, yet I am anxious.	What is the subject??"
"Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking.	Good luck! When you feel prepared, just remember the hints and practice problems!"
"I am taking a vacation to Orange Beach, Alabama in a week! My wife and I visited the area about two years ago, and we loved it!	Sounds like an amazing trip! Will there be much downtime there between the two of you?"
"We can't wait! Have you ever been to the ocean?	I've never been to the ocean actually! I know that is beautiful. I've always wanted to go myself."
"One time my husband surprised me on our anniversary with a really pretty necklace and a trip to a Bed and Breakfast!	wow! that must have been a nice surprise!!"
"We have been married for 14 years.  Another reason it was so surprising was b/c he usually just takes me to dinner!	Wow, you are lucky to have a husband like him!"
"It was one of those keys to your heart type.  Do you know what I mean?	Oh yes I do know. I have one and one half married as well. We have 7 kids and one stepmother (our forth-wived) lol."
"Yes the ones from Kay Jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top	Oh wow! Kay Jewelers? I have never heard of them.  I use those jewelers on my car, but they're pretty pricey."
"I went to the store for sodas and it ended up being a rough trip.	Why? What happened?"
"I dropped my money while my hands were full, ran into the door, and the bag busted sending a 2 liter bouncing through the parking lot. And of course there were a lot of people that saw.	That sucks, did you get a soda refund at least?"
"I suspect that my husband is fixing a lot to go to a party, I suspect he is going to see someone	Who are you suspecting he is going to go to a party?"
"I'm going to take some time and I'll be looking at it with caution	What sort of things are you suspecting he is going to do?"
"sure ... thanks	My sister is always the sibling that my parents talk about. Sometimes I wonder if they even notice me.	Maybe they just envy you.  I do that."
"I haven't. I'm scared that it would just make the situation worse. Do you think I should tell them how I feel?	You could always try and get a confession"
"My boss finally realized all the hard work I've been doing lately.	Oh that's great news! What finally convinced him?"
"Things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately, but mine finally came through at a good time!	That is awesome. You must feel pretty lucky!"
"Thanks. And it's the weekend. Perfect timing.	I was on an airplane last week, and someone's baby would not stop crying. I know it isn't right to be upset about such things, but it really bothered me.	That's awful!  Babies are always so precious!  Was it someone's kid?"
"I tried to think about that, but I was still aggravated. On the plus side, at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational.	That's a good point. Baby's need someone like you to keep them company!"
"I was given a job offer at a new company. I decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty.	That sounds like a great decision."
"Yes, I think so as well. The new company offered me approximately $10,000 more a year than my current business is paying though.	Are you making more money than your current job is offering?"
"My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady.	What a nice surprise! What's the address?"
"I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card, but she is living on a fixed income.	How is it going?"
"A tornado blew through my town last week. My family hid in our storm shelter, but I wasn't sure if we were going to survive it unscathed.	That is crazy, are you ok?"
"Thank you! We were rather frightened, and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended.	Where did you move to after that happened?"
"Hello the plants in my garden I water them, I move the earth, I try to keep them happy	That is so relaxing! I love relaxing moments when people do nice things."
"Especially when you feel something special by nature	Do you have any animals?"
"I hope this feeling increases	My wife has a big birthday coming up and I've got a great weekend all laid out for her.	That's great!  What do you have planned?"
"We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years.	You sound like you really enjoy your wife.  I hope the party goes smoothly and that the marriage is going well!"
"Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows, but I can't really tell for sure.	She must really like to have fun with friends! Sounds fun! Where is the surprise party at?"
"Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!	That was probably my fault then. I hate being flattered."
"Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.	Well, now you know your friend is a reliable guy."
"Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.	Oh no! That must've been awful"
"Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'	Haha, I'm sorry you had to deal with that"
"I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom, ever!	That's the worst!  That always irritates me when I'm on the road and have to clean up after others!"
"I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!	I am sorry to hear that! But they must have been so busy to clean everything right away!"
"I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding!	What kinda TV?"
"Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?	Could always buy another"
"it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.	That would annoy me too, is she always expecting it?"
"Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.	Yea that is infuriating! How do they get away with that?"
"I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic.	Oh yeah? It is always nice doing those things with old friends! Are you guys really getting along?"
"it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup.	Good to hear, it sounds like it was lots of catching up to do"
"I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.	Two classes? Wow, must be a really intensive coursework."
"Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!	That's ridiculous! I'm glad that is over!"
"Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been.	I'm happy for you!"
"Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!	That's great! I'm happy to hear that!"
"My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness	God is always good to people."
"I wish they did not suffer, because it is my suffering	That is very sweet and true"
"Thanks for your comprehension	Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window.	Wow!  I bet that must've scared everyone!  Were you all okay? Were the windows broken?"
"By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.	That must've been terrifying, my mom's insensitivity to storms can get pretty bad!"
"I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.	Lupus is terrible! I think it's genetic. Have you heard of the internet to try to find a blood relative?"
"No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed	I have lupus. Not super rare and you really don't want that bad of an outcome to play out in your life, but if it's ever gonna happen you better make sure you have the strongest possible medicine just in case."
"no it is an autoimmune disease	Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken	I'm so sorry to hear that. How long ago did you first hear about this?"
"one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel	I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope everything turns your day."
"is that he loved her	This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from.	Did you check the fridge?"
"Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky.	That's disgusting! What was you'saction after you noticed that?"
"I recently went on a trip with a woman I adore. The trip ended poorly, though, and things have not been the same since.	I'm sorry, that must have been disappointing. Did everything turn your ok after that?"
"We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.	Im sorry to hear that. I hate when things dont work out"
"If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!	Hahaha!  Maybe you should set up an alarm at night!"
"You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.	Yeah, that would have scared me too!"
"Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.	I think subtlety would be good for asking for permission to use a bathroom or other common bathroom. But you're absolutely right about the need for good manners, I guess."
"I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!	Well, if someone were to make noise in your neighborhood maybe it'd be more discreet"
"I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!	I'm so sorry! I hope everything works out."
"I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!	I hope it all works out for you."
"From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?	I broke an ankle 4 months ago and it has been swollen ever since, tornados and tornados give me the runs!! I fell in the middle of nowhere and couldn't stop walking. I don't even have insurance!!"
"Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.	I'm so sorry. I hope it's not too embarrasing."
"The weather here feels kinda mild today, I'm shocked that it's only in the 80s in August.	80's Felt like a breeze today. breeze and sirens!"
"I am. It's not blazing hot so I plan on mowing the grass and getting some yardwork done.	Sounds like a great plan. It's been raining a lot here lately too. Maybe you should move?"
"Writing speeches makes me nervous	Have you ever done one before or do you find them nervewracking?"
"Yeah, it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience	You never know, you might just be better prepared to speak in front of people"
"True, a lot of people don't even have to think about what they're gonna say	I don't watch a lot of kids movies these days, but they always bring back fond memories	What movies do you like to watch then"
"I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times, that and Harry Potter!	I love trolls, those were the best years of my life!"
"Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react	I've never seen the movie but have always wanted to lol."
"Yeah, maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything	Yeah, it's really frustrating. I mean I watch previews for movies I know will make a lot of money but I end up blocking them. It's so easy to be offended though..."
"Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life	That is good to hear. Do you feel like you are ready for it?"
"Dairy Queen, it was the only restaurant in my town	That sounds nice, was you tipped as well?"
"True, most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.	I haven't been to Dairy Queen in a while... I need on a treat"
"Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either	Most of us don't have as much of a need to work as some would hope though."
"Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day	That is so true!"
"Yeah, someone paid for this guy's groceries in the store without asking!	That is awesome."
"Yeah I think we should have more of that kind of thing	Rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking	Was it on a bike or a car?"
"I found a bike on the side of the road but didn't test it before coasting down this hill	You must have been quite scared, did you stay on the bike for a while?"
"Yeah, usually I don't trust myself with those kinds of things, but I decided to go for it, rolled on some grass to lose a little speed	When you're in the sauna and the man next to you decides to take off his towel... No thanks	hahah that is so funny!"
"Yeah, I'm not good with confrontations	I always take off my towel when going to the locker rooms. It makes it so I don't get trail of life."
"I don't think I've ever regretted not saying anything, but sometimes I can say the wrong thing or it just comes out wrong	I found out yesterday at work that I'm one of the top performers for my district!  I figured I was doing good, I didn't know I was doing *that* well!	That's amazing! Congratulations! That must feel like a great feeling!"
"Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!	Wow that's great! Congratulations!"
"How long have you been there?	It hasn't been too bad.  It was bad when she broke the news about me wanting to be fired, but she seems to be picking back up recently"
"I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?	I just got hired to start a practice law firm next month!"
"My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!	wow that's a good thing they did that fast!"
"Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries, but the rest - I should save it, my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.	That was really lucky of them!  That makes me feel a lot better about my bank!"
"If I had dispensible funds like that, there'd definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it, but alas, priorites.  *lol*	I found out I was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!	That's fantastic! Congrats!!"
"I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That's a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*	I know that feeling! What restaurant?"
"I'm just happy to be recognized, especially since most times I just see myself as a 'cog in the wheel'.	That's so great. I hope you really enjoyed that gift."
"I just do the best I can - that's all anyone really expects.	So I forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the store today.	Oh no! You must feel guilty about this. You must feel guilty for forgetting to get him something."
"He kinda gave me the ""Mom, really?"" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*	haha that sounds good!"
"I do, too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].	Hah, yeah that happens sometimes to us when we are kids too! I hope you're not too disappointed with him."
"It's easier with a list but still, you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD	Oh no! How old is he now?"
"I forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store.	Aw man! You can't unpack that stuff! You better pack it for him!"
"No, I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him, I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.	That's good. I always like riding with my little son. I'm sure that will make for an exciting day!"
"Multiple bags of chips, to be sure!  *chuckle*	Oh that's good. I live in the city too, so when I have to eat out it's no big deal. I do it because I want fresh fruits and veggies."
"Those are a lifesaver - he's in Scouts and he's starting soccer soon.  Those 24 packs are the best!	My landlady was really understanding when I told her that I would be late with rent this month.	Did she give notice when you told her?"
"I was nervous about talking to her because I hate having to disappoint her - she's related to me.  So I didn't think she'd be as cool about it as she was.	It's nice she was patient. I always like my bosses being understanding when they have problems.  Did everything go over well with the rent?"
"Yeah, I think that's where the anxiety was - the not knowing.	I had a big presentation yesterday but I think I nailed it!	That's great. What was it about?"
"I had to explain global warming to my son's Boy Scout troop.	wow that is such an accomplishment!"
"Nope, just a mom.  I had to do some research on the internet and it was a real eye-opener for me.  I believe in global warming but a lot of the facts on both sides of the argument surprised even me.	I broke up with my boyfriend last week.	how did you hear about what happened?"
"Well, I'm hanging in there.  This is the first weekend we've not been together and outside of being online, the quiet is kinda loud.	You are a stronger soul than I am! I hope he is in a better place!"
"Yeah.  It's a positive that we broke up, I'm just looking for healthy ways to deal with the energy that's left.	I found out that I'm getting a bonus for having the top rating in my district!	Oh how cool!  Congratulations!  I hope you like it?"
"I help manage distribution for a large company in my city.  Really I just hold a clipboard and crunch lots of numbers.  LOL	That's great! Good job!"
"This is my first bonus in 10 years.  After feeling like a cog in the wheel, it's nice that someone noticed my hard work!	I was so blissful after the births of both my girls. Such a sense of peace and relief on both a mental and physical level!	Aww thats awesome! How old are they?"
"15 and 19! It hasn't always been blissful, as any relationship's journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you'll be a dad...?	Wow! Good for you! That is one tough road you're on. Congrats! How did the delivery go?"
"Ah, make the most of your nieces + nephews! You get to be the fun/cool/understanding uncle -- someone maybe a little more objective to turn to (depending on age!)	Seems like every time we get a bill and I think I know how much it is, it	Hm.. I don't know what to tell ya.. What do you think is going to happen?"
"Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to say haha hit enter too early. I thought we had lowered the electric use but boy was I wrong!	Haha that happens to me all the time. I guess ""If it doesn't rain often, it's not a problem."""
"The start of school for my 2 teenagers is less than a week away!	Lesson 1 starts tomorrow.  Summer vacations are always a good idea"
"It is! We actually got everything they need and more, except for a few notebooks.	Awww, teenagers!  I'm so excited for them!  Are you happy for them, too?"
"The other day I was just having a really off day. Just couldn't get my mind and body to work right.	I am sorry to hear that, I am also sorry about today. What happened?"
"It does but I'm sure the people at the busy store thought I was drunk. I ran into everything, shelves, displays and even the door when I was leaving.	Oh no! Did they tell you why?"
"really didnt want to anything for days	Why not? What stopped you from taking a trip?"
"I studied really hard all night infact but when my results came, i had nothing to show for it"".	Sometimes you got to do what you gotta do"
"it is indeed. wont happen again though	I was attending a conference and heard the minister speak. he spoke with such grace that i was proud to be from that district"".	Wow, congrats! What was he saying?"
"it was. i always questioned how he got the position but it makes sense now	That's really awesome!"
"I feel uneasy because I don't know if I will be able to save enough money in time	Have you thought about investing in stocks or borrowing money?"
"Baby is due in less than 3 months	3 months seems short, but it's never to late!"
"I worked hard all night for that exam. it takes 5 months to get the results back. the wait is killing me	What is your degree in?"
"5 months to find out !	wow, 5 months to find out? That seems like a lot of time!"
"I tried so hard for that exam, when i found out i got first! it was overwhelming!	thats amazing, good job!"
"thanks. now onto bigger things	Congratulations! What things did you study if I may ask?"
"starting a clinic	it was the grand opening for our restaurant. The whole town was there. almost double the number of people we were expecting	That's awesome. You must be so proud of the restaurant!"
"thanks. i think its an achivement of the whole town	That's awesome. I love restaurants that have a big presence in town.  I hope you enjoyed the weekend!"
"I had no confidence and didn't have a girlfriend until age 22. I carried a lot of hatred towards girls because of this	Sorry about your problems. You will find somebody good in your life."
"Oh yes. It all changed when I directed what was inside towards the gym	What changed your path?"
"I'm happy with my daily routine. I don't like change	It is nice to have some time to rest.  What do you like to do for fun?"
"Especially when it comes to food. Like breakfast. I eat the same thing daily.	That is so good to hear! I wish I could do that! How long do you have on your routine?"
"I can get fit in 3 months. Takes discipline	That's awesome! I need more discipline.  How do you do that?"
"I eat plenty of carbs. It's all about timing	What type of diet do you follow"
"the floods destroyed everything. The insurer is not returning our calls	That's too bad to hear!"
"Last week. we're in temporary housing now	That's too bad to here. I hope you and your family is ok"
"I was just a kid but can't forget that day I left him alone in the rain. He should've just taken my hand!	I used to leave my little boy alone in rains too, how times have changed haha. How is he today?"
"I don't know what happened to that kid to be honest.	Rain can make you forget a lot of stuff."
"I recieved a call from my mother today.  She said she was in town.	Oh that must have been exciting for both of you!"
"Yes she took me out to a restaurant and presented me with a book I had been wanting.	What book was it"
"I can't find another way to earn money	I'm sorry, what do you do to earn money?"
"I just want to work from home	ukulele staking is good way"
"I can't wait for my baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now	Wow.  That is soon!  What are you going to name him/"
"You know, not much to be honest. Just a few clothes and things. Need the buggy asap	That is awesome!  I know right!  I have 4 boys myself"
"I pray to God that every worry will be taken care of. Especially the baby essentials	I have the same issue. My biggest worry is having too much work and home life. How do you handle it?"
"I sure do. A baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now but it's hard saving up money. Just had a major car repair. It has set me way back	Oh no! I'm sorry you're having car troubles. I'm sure you'll be alright!"
"She refused me but then a few days later I saw her and she was embarrassed of her lie. I was shorter and younger than the other guy.	Wow, what did you do? Did you confront her?"
"Yeah. I put her through hell that school year. Made up all sorts of rumors	That's a shame! I'm glad she was embarrassed, but that sounds horrible and sounds like a lie."
"I got angry when she refused. But I should've been more understanding	Why did she refuse"
"I shouldn't have forced the issue and so I promised never to ask again	Why was it that big a deal that you couldn't ask?"
"I got my four year old daughter her first tricycle yesterday.	That's so cool. Is she looking forward to it?"
"She was having such a blast she went downhill and toppled over.  She took it like a champ but I was scared.	That's amazing! How old is she?"
"I did so much practice running in preparation for my 50 metre sprint race at my school!	I would imagine thats very hard! How did you feel afterwards?"
"I do! I am so motivated to win and I believe I am one of the fastest at my school.	You must be quite proud of your achievement! What school do you go to?"
"I feel nostalgic when playing old school games with my bro	Which one were you playing with him?"
"Yes and also Sega Genesis. We play these on the xbox one though via emulation	I love playing old sega games"
"I was so scared of going onto the train!	Oh no!  What made you scared?  The weather or the trip?"
"No but I hate going in objects that travel fast, I really did not want to go on it.	Yeah, the train is no fun.  I used to be scared too because of the movies!"
"I am going to get us a new car!	That sounds like so much fun! What kind of car?"
"I'm not sure yet. Maybe a Toyota	That's a good choice! They are very reliable and a great car to have!"
"I introduced my oldest daughter to the movie Fight Club the other day.	Wow that's so dark. Did she enjoy it?"
"She loved it.  She's 17, I was 18 when it came out and I would watch it all the time with my friends back then.	Wow, you are a brave and brave person! Good for you showing your age!"
"I can't seem to feel happy but I'm not depressed	why are you feeling unhappy"
"I just feel kinda stuck in life	I understand that completely, sometimes it's just the simpleton's paradox of wanting to be happy while at the same time being sad that gets us! It's an interesting feeling to me personally, so I can relate."
"I had pizza at a restaurant a couple days ago and found a hair on my pizza!	That's gross! Did you complain?"
"I told the waited and demanded a refund! It was gross.	That's disgusting! I wouldn't of gone for the pizza though..."
"I finally got a new bike! I've been wanting one for so long!	Awesome! I love bikes! What kind did you get?"
"I hope so, my new bike has so many gears. Such an upgrade from my last one! I can't wait to take it out.	That sounds awesome! I hope it feels great to ride with you."
"Pretty soon I'll be taking over my parents mortgage.  Homeownership is on the horizon.	Congratulations! I am sure that you have a very stressful time in the making."
"A huge step. But I'm done with renting and I have a lot of renovating plans in the works.	Nice! I'm sure it will be a good decision for you."
"I'm the only one who cares about paying bills. It's very frustrating	I feel your pain. My sister in law is like that too."
"Unfortunately no. It's very hard on me because I have to be disciplined with spending. Makes life very boring	I know what you mean, it's very stressful and I'm glad there's someone out there that cares about it!"
"I have a beautiful gray cat named Stormy.  Unfortunately she's contracted feline AIDS.	That's terrible, I've had one fatter sister who looked almost exactly like my cat too. Are you thinking about getting another one?"
"Yep, she's pretty far gone now.  I now have to consider putting her down.	That's sad to here. I have a friend who had to get his dog breed specific since it affected him. It's really sad to hear about other animals getting hurt so violently."
"I just got an assigment.  I was doing well on it but rushed through the very end.  Now I'm not sure I'll be paid.	That sucks. I hope you get paid eventually."
"I can no longer prove I did the assignment.  Computer work is for the birds sometimes.	Oh no that's not good! I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe there's some online work that you can try and do that?"
"I found an old picture in a box of my Great Grandparents.	What was it of?"
"Not visibly.  It was a picture from their wedding day and it brought a smile to my face to see them so young.	I love that picture, it is so cute!"
"I got a letter from my parents this past Friday with a wonderul surprise in it.	what was the surprise?"
"Just a little spending cash.  Nothing outrageous, but enough to take the wife out and have a good time with.	That's cool! I hope you guys spend a lot of time together!"
"Last night I was walking home from work in a bad part of town, I was a bit scared.	Oh no, that's always scary! Were you okay?"
"I agree. It was a bit foolish on my part and I don't want to risk myself nor be worried again. Thanks for the advice.	It happens. Just remember to be brave and take it one day at a time"
"When I was 19 I stole money from a good friend in order to buy some food.  He asked me about it and I denied knowing anything.	What really happened at that point in time?  Did you feel remorse?"
"No, I was going to but he said if he every found out I stole it, it wouldn't matter if I paid it back.  So I kept silent, its been 17 years now.	Wow that sounds like it could have been a really dark moment for both of you."
"I was one percent off from passing my math test, I was devastated.	Math is never my friend."
"I agree, I should of studied harder too. Practice makes perfect!	yea thats true.. but like one time I cheated.."
"Last night I was minding my own business walking down a street in a not so good area of town when someone started to chase me!	Oh my, what did you do?! I hope they were stopped!"
"I managed to get away after a few smart quick turns, but I was shaking and in fear at the end of the chase. It was wild.	Oh wow! Did the person in the chase stop?"
"I was looking through old stuff in my basement and found my old baseball cards! Finding those was like being a kid all over again!	Wow, finding cards can be a lot! Did you play on those cards often as a kid?"
"I used to collect so many when I was younger, it was such an awesome feeling to see them again!	Wow that is really awesome, I have not collected baseball in a while either."
"I was feeling so optimistic about getting a new job at Houston a while back	what kind of job did you get?"
"Yeah actually, i am still working on it. So much fun!	Cool, what industry do you work in?"
"I was so much in awe when i saw Hamilton!	I don't know that movie. What was it?"
"Neither, i am talking about the broadway show :D	oh really? I've never heard of that"
"I went to the beach other day.. such an awesome feeling standing there	The sound of the waves was exhilarating, like a breath taking"
"I most certainly did.. There is something about looking at the calm and glory of the ocean.	i love going to the beach. i wish i could do it more often"
"I felt so bad about cheating on my science exam, it was terrible	Did you tell a teacher?"
"I know, I am disgusted at myself for doing it. I just wanted to pass.	Don't be too hard on yourself. You did your time and did the best you could with what you had studied."
"I'm taking my wife out this coming weekend to dance.	that's nice. i hope it goes well."
"We haven't been able to go out in quite a long time.  Family and life stuff just gets in the way sometimes.	That is understandable! Have you always been able to do that?"
"My dog passed away couple months back.. i was heartbroken	I'm sorry to hear that. Were you able to get over the loss quickly and comfort yourself at least."
"She got run by a truck.. I felt guilty and blue	That is so sad. How are you holding up now?"
"I always get sad thinking about my dad.	I'm so sorry to hear about that.  What sorts of memories resurfaced from him>"
"Yeah.. he did. He had cancer.	That is sad, my dad had cancer too."
"I went to the beach other day	That's fun! Did you have a good time there?"
"I sure did! the ocean and the breeze gives me such a sense of joy and calm	I do love the sound of the ocean, did you go on a vacation or something?  I've never been on one"
"I was so happy that i got to see Hamilton the other day	That's an awesome movie. Was it good, too?"
"Yeah, the same. Lin Manuel is a genius to say the least!	What did he do?"
"I went to visit my family the other day	Did you have a good visit?"
"It was such a joyful experience. They always warm my heart	That's cool.  I live far away from my family.  But I get what you on.  How long have you been waiting for?"
"A dog chased me through a street the other day	Oh no!  Did it get you too scared?"
"No i somehow managed to escape.. it was so scary	Oh my goodness! Did you get away from the dog, or did the dog chase you too? Were you able to get home safely?"
"I feel so caring of my little sister	That's sweet! How old is she?"
"Yeah.. I always look out for her no matter what the problem is	Is there any major problem?"
"I was really nervous when i went to meet my girl's parents	Why is that"
"It turned out well actually, we had a nice time	awww thats great! How long were you waiting to meet them?"
"A dog chased me through our street last night	Oh no! Did you chase the dog or did the dog get you?"
"I think so.. it looked like that. I was shivering when i finally managed to escape	Oh my gosh!  That must be terrifying!  Did you chase it after you ran?"
"I really envy people who can sing	I'm not good singer but I do have a singing voice.  Don't be jealous!  You're so lucky!"
"Yeah.. i did. i never got the chance to pursue that	I am sorry.  If you really want to be a singer, just start singing."
"I had to leave the house for a bit, before I left I gave my kids instructions on what I wanted them to do around the house.	How'd it go, do they do what you want them to do?"
"I figured they would just goof off.  However; when I returned all chores were comples.  I was pretty impressed.	That was nice of you.  I'm glad you got instructions!  That usually makes chores much easier."
"i found a bunch of dead mice the other day	How gross! I hope they didn't bring you more trouble as a result!"
"it was! i felt sick seeing that	Oh no, I bet that made you feel sick!"
"how sweet. bless you!	Why, thank you!"
"5	5 what?"
"5	My Mother came into town unannounced.  She hardly ever does that.	That must have made you feel a little jealous, Did you talk to her about it?"
"No.  Thankfully it was just a visit.  She took us all to dinner, it was nice.	That's awesome!  Did you have fun at least?"
"i was so furious when i found out that my best friend and girl friend had made out	Thats not good!  Did they even have good reason to?"
"I have not confronted them. I am still thinking over it.	Oh my, I hope that nothing came out and you guys are still okay."
"A big brown roach crawled across the floor in my direction last night.	Oh my word! Did you kill it? You may have saved yourself a lot of time and frustration."
"Yes, but this one didn't fly.  He just decided to go under the chair I was sitting in.	That is so creepy, but if he didn't fly then that means there was an even bigger fly in the chair too.  I would be more scared!"
"My bills and mortgage payment is coming up soon.  I not sure if I can cover them all.	Are you at a very low monthly payment?  If not, might be time to look at getting another job."
"I am working hard to make sure I can cover them.  Hope fully this month of work is better than last month.	I'm sure that it will be better! You should try to do what you can."
"I made sure everything was set and proper before i went abroad	Oh, where were you travelling?"
"5	When I got my first car I thought I'd finally be able to have a cool social life.  But I was dissapointed quickly.	What happened?"
"I spent my first night out at a Whataburger, eating alone.	I used to go to KFC when I was younger.  I miss the good ol days."
"i felt so guilty after lying to my girlfriend	What did you say?"
"I kissed a mutual friend of ours. I lied when she checked up on me. It was a one time thing, i did not wanted to hurt her.	Sometimes you got to just do what you think is best... and hope it's not bad!"
"I once lied about kissing the most popular girl at my school. and my friend found out about it	That wasn't very nice."
"I was, so very much! I avoided my friends for a whole week thenafter	Wow. How popular is she? She may have just found out from someone higher up."
"My four year old daughter came up and told me she thought I needed a big hug and kiss.	Aw, is she older or still a kitten? That's amazing!"
"She jumped in my lap and peppered my cheek with kisses.  It was pretty cute.	That's sweet! It's always nice to see little kids showing off how much they love and are devoted to their loved ones."
"I felt so very nervous after i agreed to meet my girlfriend's parents	Oh no.. why did it make you so nervous"
"Well, i lost a few pounds on the weeks leading upto it. But the actual meeting went well	Are you going to be with her parents for a reunion?"
"I have always wanted to join a college faculty.  I went to school to study philosophy for that reason.	That's pretty neat! I was kind of thinking that way as well, since my goal is to get my foot in the door into the real world. What kind of education are you hoping to get?"
"Unfortunately not.  In the end I ran out of money and had to leave that dream behind.	That's too bad, hopefully you find another scholarship."
"I feel so sad this time of the year. My dad passed away this time last year	I am sorry, thats terrible. I bet it was hard"
"I'm sorry? Are you still talking about the cops?	No, the cops are terrible. What about you? Any relatives around?"
"I feel heartbroken whenever i see a picture of my dog	I understand. Dogs live with us. Do you have any pictures of him/her you can share with us?"
"It is ok.. She passed away few months ago	My son and I went to the track yesterday to run.	Oh that sounds exciting! How did it go"
"No, but he did end up puking all over the parking lot afterwards.	Oh no! I'm sorry! I hope he didn't feel too guilty! That must have been a pretty gross experience."
"That is really cool. i bet it felt nice watching those	It sure did man. What was it?"
"I envy people who can dance really well	It was really cool! It was like watching someone jump higher!"
"I was stunned with fear to find a rattlesnake right where i was about to step into last week	Wow that must have been terrifying! Are you ok now?"
"I stood there speechless for a moment, turned back and ran for my life!	Did he catch you?"
"Needing some extra money, I used the spare change in my car to buy a scratch off ticket.	Oh no. Did you manage to get it all sorted out though?"
"It was Blackjack.  I didn't win anything though.	I am sorry to hear that."
"I once ate a piece of cake, it was old.  After the first bite I noticed spots of mold on it.	Oh no! That's a shame! Did you tell the seller?"
"No I spit it out and listerined my mouth.	That is so gross."
"I was heartbroken when my mom told me that my childhood dog had died	Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Was it a pretty devastating loss for the dog."
"I'm coping with it. So many memories with her	That's really sad to hear. How long did you have your dog for?"
"my brother passed away 2 years ago and i'm still so heartbroken. it still hurts so much	oh i am sorry to hear about that! my condolences   to all around"
"thank you. I'm sure it will get easier with time. It was just so tragic, he was so young	I'm so sorry to hear that. Life does get easier. Just hang in there...."
"I am so angry to see so much fake news floating around in the media	Yeah me too, it can be so fake sometimes."
"Very true! Why does news have to be so hyped up?	Because gullible people believe anything they hear.  It is quite sad actually, quite sad."
"My little girl loves to wake up at night and ask for chocolate milk.	Is there any store you can buy it at that sells only organic milk?"
"I have an 18 year old doing the same.  What my 4 year old doesn't know is I giver her the sugar free version.	That's sweet, it's nice to have a little girl who wants to be a kid again!"
"I lost a good job a few years back	im sorry, how did that happen?"
"The company got bought by someone else and we all got laid off.  Lost my family home and all.  But things are slowly improving.	Sorry to hear about that. It sounds like you have had a hard time getting out of the place."
"So i used to shop in walmart and i thought it was the cheapest place to shop at but yesterday i went grocery shopping at aldi's and i was so surprised to see how much cheaper it is to shop there	Yeah, the things you don't even think about can really add up!"
"you should give it a try! They have their own brands which are super cheap and the quality is great	Aldis is German owned, right? So they are sort of a German supermarket, but yeah, that sounds awesome to me! I will give them a try, thanks for the tip!"
"I am really looking forward to the new season of the Lakers	Me too! Do you live in Los Angeles?"
"Hell yeah! i am sure we are going to perform really well this season	I've never been to Lakers hell yeah! Have they been doing well?"
"I always feel sad when i think about my dad, he passed away few years back	I'm so sorry to hear about that! Did he at least live a happy life with his dementia, if i may ask?"
"He had lung cancer..	Sorry to hear about that.  Did he have a good life though?"
"My friends are saying my girlfriend is cheating behind my back, but i trust her	How long have you been friends with her?  Has it been more than a month now?"
"May be. But i have known her all my life, she would die before going behind my back	People say that all the time but they're kidding. She's obviously not."
"I have a lot of stuff coming up due this month.  I also have a lot of purchasing goals as well.  I am confident I will be able to meet all of them.	What are some of the goals you're working towards?"
"That's the plan, I've signed up for a bunch of double shifts.  Fingers crossed.	Good luck and I hope it all works out!"
"I was so thrilled to get to see Hamilton, i was really looking forward to it	I've never seen it, was good movie tho?"
"It is the broadway show, by Lin manuel miranda	I love Broadway shows! I bet that was exciting for you"
"My dog started walking again after an accident she had	Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that! Did you get her back up and running?"
"She fell down from the first floor..	Oh my goodness that's scary! How old is the dog??"
"I used to be a member of a very cool dance crew. I miss those days	What kind of things did you participate in?"
"mostly hip hop. We were travelling and battling with other teams. It was really fun	That's so exciting!  Where were the Crew at in the Crew Crew Crew?  Crew?  That's so cool to me though, because the Crew was the first dance promotion in my entire family.  I loved dancing!  Have you heard of hip hop?  No, I really haven't."
"i wan to participate in a bodybuilding contest! I'm sure i will win it!	That's awesome! Have you been working on any routines for it?"
"That's not true! I'm actually vegan and I don't make steroids and I looks pretty amazing. I don't need to use none to participate or win	You can still win if you are on some sort of performance drugs! Don't be so down on yourself."
"I felt so proud when my son got good grades in school last month	That's awesome! I'm happy to here that! Did he help you with anything else?"
"Oh alright then, feel good	i feel alone whenever i think about my dad, he passed away last year	im sorry to hear about that."
"yeah.. i know.. memories still haunt though..	I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. Are you close?"
"I was really nervous when my girl asked me to meet her parents	Why were you so nervous?  Did you have to go through an interview?"
"I was really close to running away, but i somehow managed to pull it off	What?! That's amazing! How far did you run?"
"my friend bought a big house and i'm happy for her but at the same time i'm a little bit jealous	Maybe you should move out! lol"
"true, but there is so much space for her kid to run and play at and I live in a tiny apartment with my son	I understand your jealousy. I'm sure she feels more than happy with the house."
"I was so mad when i found out my cousin asked out my girlfriend once	I'm guessing she didn't like your brother?"
"Sort of, yes. He did it anyways. I yelled at him.	That's not very nice."
"I feel happy when I am outside in nature	i too"
"I love to garden. Organic gardening, I plant peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and a bunch of other goodies.	I'm the same way! I grew all of my own tomatoes and peppers!"
"Just get outside and started playing / digging  in the dirt, You will soon catch on to what works for you.	i was so in awe when i saw hamilton	Did he do an interview for the Times?"
"It was really awesome dude, the full show covers it all up	What is the full show?"
"I took my daughter out to the skate park today.	That sounds like fun! How old is she?"
"Awesome! She went down the big ramp today for the first time. It was so cool.	That's great! I took my son to a park once and we ended up skipping for half the day!"
"It really bothers me when people come into where we live at night and ride their dirt bikes	I live at night too, sometimes i come across motorcycles and some people are very careless."
"There is many paths leading to faith	I agree, those bikes can cause road rage!"
"It takes a path to find ones faith	Are you a parent.	No, why would I be?"
"When you become one, you will never forget the day it happens. You'll weep of happiness.	I am and I totally agree"
"I think i have anxiety attacks! I didn't even know that anxiety causes some physical pain. like the other day i felt like somebody was chocking me	Do you have anxiety too? If you did, did you tell your doctor about it so he could fix it for you?"
"yes! And i felt like that for 3 days on and off!	Oh no I'm so sorry! Maybe try to have an advocate come to your home to help you."
"We planned our honeymoon and booked a flight but I was so nervous about flying.	Was it overbooking?"
"I found that out, after many sleepless nights. Now we fly all the time and I love it. I feel kind of silly.	It happens to the best of us! I think it is better to be nervous and excited than happy and nervous!"
"My sister recently paid off her house. I felt so envious of her as I've been trying to pay mine down.	That is really awesome! I am so proud of you!"
"I really am trying hard to- that's such a great suggestion. I know I'm making good progress to my goal, and I genuinely am pleased she did it!	That is such a great idea. You should be proud of yourself"
"I used to be soooooo territorial of my boyfriend (now husband of decades!) when were dating.	Aw, that's cute!  How was the relationship before and after?"
"Yes, but when we were younger -- he didn't really understand. And truly, it was more about my own insecurities than about him, you know? As I grew more into myself, the jealousy loosened its hold.	That sounds like a pretty interesting story. Did you two ever develop an outside relationship (or did you still stay seperate)"
"My daughter and her family were on their way from ohio to visit us.	How wonderful! How long will they be staying?"
"I prepared for weeks. I could not wait for them to get here. It had been almost a whole year since I had seen them and they have a new baby.	That's awesome!  So happy they got here!  What did you guys do with it all?"
"I cosigned a loan with my son, expecting he would make the payments and he has let me down by being late every month.	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think it's due to his mental illness?"
"I've helped me create a repayment plan where I have paid the loan payments and he can catch back up by paying me. I just really feel frustrated because he has the money, but he wastes it.	That's frustrating for everyone. You should tell him how disappointed you are in him."
"I was anticipating a great weight loss after my first week on my diet!	I can see why! What's helped is cutting down on carbs and moving to more plant based meals like lentil soup and chick peas!"
"I lost 7 pounds! I am SO thrilled because it was challenging to follow the plan all week long.	That's great! How did it go?"
"I have felt some of the best moments of pure happiness seeing someone I love getting something they've worked hard for -- like my daughter's acceptance into her college and major of choice!	That's wonderful! I'm happy for your daughter, too. I hope everything continues to work out and you guys meet in the future! I bet she'll end up loving all of you guys very soon."
"Absolutely! Of course, now the real work begins ;-) But her *knowing* that it was her hard work paid off in such a gratifying way -- ah, so happy for her!	That is amazing! I am happy that your daughter is excited about college too!"
"I was disappointed when I realized someone close to me was not who I thought they were.	Im so sorry!  Ive been there more than I like to admit."
"Well, in a sense. But to be fair, I may have had my own ""vision"" of who they were and held them to that standard -- not really seeing them for who they were. I have to accept some responsibility for that, you know?	Yeah, I get that. It happens to all of us. It was just a day at the office, nothing more than that. But I still felt a sense of obligation to make sure everyone was okay"
"I've definitely worked through that! Happily, it hasn't affected my ability to trust -- just inspired me to be more truthful with myself and others ;-)	I recently met up with a friend I had not seen in a while. I want to see him again soon and I think I will!	That is good. Do you often get together?"
"I agree. We went to high school and middle school together.	Nice, middle and school were always good times. I'm glad to here about the high school reunion"
"In college I studied very hard for an upcoming exam that I was very interested in getting a very high score. I was confident that I did so.	Oh nice. What subject was it?"
"I was very excited with my result. I am very competitive. Sometimes I wish I were not so competitive.	Competition is healthy sometimes! What college you attend?"
"You are completely right. It is very important to not lose sight of what is important in life.	A have a friend that is going to be visiting me this week! I cannot wait!	That's cool!  Where are they going?"
"She was a very close college friend and now she lives a few hours south.	That's awesome! I'm glad you get to catch up with her.  I'm visiting myself this weekend and I'm a bit envious of how far away I am to have a friend like that."
"I am currently dealing with epilepsy unfortunately, and the doctors have not found a treatment yet.	Have you spoken with a psy doctor?"
"Thanks. I have to go to a Monitoring Unit in two weeks where they will induce seizures to see if they can pinpoint their location. Not going to be fun.	I am sorry to hear that, I hope that you get well soon."
"Thanks again. I have lots of support so I am fortunate	I've felt so incredibly sad whenever we've had to say goodbye to any of our dogs.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that! What happened to them?"
"I know -- I needed to just come out and say ""when we had to put them down"". Always age or illness related -- but man, SO tough.	I am sorry for your loss. I have lost my two dogs. They were 15 years old and 14-year old girls."
"My friend has been on the couch for a few weeks. He is getting under my skin now.	That is so annoying! Why is he always on the couch?"
"No, he is a friend that recently got fired and needs some help.	You should talk to him about it!"
"I have been trying to lose weight in a group and while i made it to 4 lbs, my friends made it to 15. :(	I'm sorry to hear that. Losing weight is hard, especially when you have to chase those beautiful healthy eating habits."
"i guess they worked harder but	How long have they been in a group?"
"I went on a road trip with some friends. We had a wonderful time hanging out on the beach and camping, too!	Sounds like so much fun! I've always wanted to take a road trip. How far did you have to travel?"
"Yes, sometimes I leave it away and that makes me appreciate everything else more.	Yes I agree. Beach trips are awesome"
"We paid 600$ for a cruise, but they canceled it with not refunds one week before. so mad	Wow that's terrible. Did they have a good reason to do so? Were you really looking forward to the trip?"
"we are currently pursuing a case against them. they are a local travel company, so they dont know what they're in for	Wow that's a rip off. Why did they cancel?"
"I had a wonderful experience with a friend a few years ago. I wonder if I will see her again any time soon.	I'm sure you will. That is a very special friendship."
"We went to the beach and had some fun in the sun and also ate dinner with some other mutual friends.	That is wonderful.  I'm sure you had a wonderful time!"
"I live alone. Sometimes it can be hard with nobody around.	I can understand that.  I'm in college and live by myself too!  It can be lonely"
"I think that's a great idea. I will try to go out this weekend.	It can also help if you have someone around that you can talk to."
"I saw a huge spider in my car yesterday. I scared me so!	did you kill it?"
"I stopped the car and got out and ushered it out of the car.	I would do the exact same thing!  You must have done it because you are brave!  I don't want to talk about how it found me.."
"I hope that this summer I can go to Florida with my family	I live in florida but not too close to florida state."
"Summer is not over until Labor Day! We still have the whole month of August!!	Wow that sounds like a fun trip.  I went to Florida on vacation with my family last year."
"Summer can be over in July for teachers sometimes. Are you a teacher?	My roommate eats my food sometimes. This makes me so angry!	Have you brought it up to your landlord?  Some don't care if others are getting sick"
"I think that's a great idea. I know where to get those fridges for cheap.	Do they keep cold?"
"I recently lost my sister to breast cancer. She was very young and has left three little girls. I have been devastated.	I am so sorry. That is so horrible. How old is she?"
"My parents health has deteriorated rapidly, and they refuse to go get counseling. It's very sad for me to see.	Oh, I'm so sorry! That's awful. That's sisters of us..they're always looking to help or find a solution to the problem!"
"It's why I think getting a counselor is so important. No one should be expected to go through this on their own.	I was recently rejected by a person that I enjoyed. You can't always get what you want.	That sucks, that sounds like you had expectations for a person that wasn't you. I guess that goes for every single rejected relationship, unfortunately. I'm sorry to hear about your situation."
"Life is not fair, but it is also amazing in that we are here to begin with	Wow that sucks. Did they like what they were rejected too?"
"I'm a little anxious about an upcoming move. It's to a *very* different state with a *very* different climate and way of life!	It's good that you're adjusting, though! I moved a couple of years ago and it's definitely an experience!"
"We've been great with change, including a few overseas moves under our belts. But this is to Anchorage! I've read a lot, and there's a lot to be excited about -- but man, those looooong winters!	That is scary! I have to move to Florida soon!"
"Ha! Not likely in the city....but hey...who knows! I WILL use the opportunity to finally learn how to cross country ski.	I lived in the country for a few years. It was fun but the cold always gets to me."
"The economy has been doing well. The future looks bright.	That's good to hear! Is it the economy that is doing well? or is the Trump Administration doing well?"
"Hopefully prosperity will carry over into the next few generations.	I am hopeful as well.   What do you think is causing the economy to be so great?"
"My sister unfortunately will not seek help for her alcohol problems, and she will not even admit to them. I am extremely sad apprehensive about what might happen to her.	Aww I'm sorry, you're not helping though! That's your brother, right?"
"I have been trying to get my family and her friends to have an intervention, but they have not agreed to it. She really needs one.	That is sad, but I understand your fear. I hope everything turns out okay"
"It was still so unexpected when my husband and I -- who were open to getting pregnant -- found out that we actually were!	That's so exciting. I'm happy you guys found out! I'm guessing he must have really been excited?"
"Oh, that was nearly 20 years ago ;-) But I'll always remember that Chicago day, Halloween, visiting the Shedd Aquarium with friends.	I am guessing the Shedd is no more?"
"The thing I most remember were the beluga whales. So beautiful, in their own weird way -- and a baby beluga had just been born. It seemed provident!	That's so cool. I love the sound of babies! And the unique way they wriggled around in the water! Very cool."
"The horror film I saw last night can cause nightmares. It was so scary!	Oh yeah? What was the film?"
"I ended up watching The Ring! It was ridiculousness.	I saw the Ring too!  I loved it!  I'm not sure if I will be as frightened as you."
"My daughter was accepted into Harvard. She starts in the fall.	That's amazing. You must be so proud."
"She worked so hard and it's really expensive so I hope so!	Wow! That's amazing! That's amazing to hear! I am so proud of her and wish her all the best!"
"My friend purchased a new car. The ride is sweet!	Oh cool! What kind of car is it?"
"They ended up getting a Honda Prelude.	That is awesome!"
"I graduated college recently. I'm so glad!	Congratulations! That's an amazing accomplishment!"
"I majored in environmental engineering!	Environmental Engineering sounds great! What are you planning on doing when you get your diploma?"
"I cheated on my girlfriend recently. I feel horrible about myself right now.	That's not good :(  Did she know?"
"I plan on coming clean at some point, but I'm not sure how to break the news.	You have a couple days to make the most of this bad experience and move on"
"I can not wait until some of my family come in to town. They will be coming in to town in two weeks.	Oh yeah? How big will your wedding be?"
"I saw them last summer which seems so long ago. I am very excited to see them because I am very close to them.	That sounds awesome!  Where are they from?  Do you all have kids?"
"I often get nostalgic when I think back to my high school years. I had some very good friends.	I do as well"
"Yes, I talk with several of them. I wish I had time to keep up with and talk to more though.	I know exactly what you mean. I was always a really good friend to my friends and had some amazing times! Time definitely does help but it's not everything."
"I saw a horror film last night! It was such a scary experience!	Oh my gosh, I hate horror movies! Were you scared at all, or just disgusted by the acting and graphics?"
"A young girl would come out of the TV if you watched a video.	What kind of movie was it? I love watching scary movies!"
"I am not really a sentimental person but I always feel so special when my husband takes me back to the place we spent our anniversary	Aww that's sweet!  It's the best feeling!"
"Yes, it is a very private Bed and Breakfast and we try to go back as often as we can.	Has he done that for you before?"
"I was devastated when I recently had to my chihuahua Riley to sleep.  She had Congestive Heart Failure.	I'm so sorry to hear that.  Is chihuahuas a breed that's easy to train, and if so that could explain her difficulties sleeping."
"Thank you.  She was my constant companion.  I loved her so much	That is so sad :( I am so sorry to hear that"
"I can not believe that Donald Trump became President. It just goes to show you that anyone can become President in the United States.	I can not disagree with you there!"
"We shall see. I truly believe that he has done some much damage to our country in so many different ways.	He is truly damaged goods. I mean, he is a millionaire but he doesn't act like a humble man."
"Once I was suppose to go visit my sister and nieces who I hadn't seen in forever but I ended up breaking my heal and big toe and wasn't able to go. I was so upset!	Oh no! How old were they? and how badly did you hurt your toe?"
"Yeah, hopefully so.  It isn't healing correctly is the problem or else I would just go in my cast.	That is scary! I hope you feel better and can visit them soon!"
"Over the summer my family went to Alabama to visit family and I felt a lot of emotions	Did you visit with your family often?  Did it make you want to go back again?"
"No, I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance	Oh, well that does not sound fun! Where did you guys go?"
"I was recently working on a project where unfortunately, my teammate really didn't pull their weight.	Pulling your weight is very different from providing useful feedback!"
"Yep. Especially when you feel that you get dinged for the overall project. And at the same time, you don't want to complain about it, because it makes *you* look bad!	That sounds terrible. teammate issues should be worked out by a committee. It would make everyone's life so much easier"
"I found out yesterday that I have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard. They can be so aggressive.	Are you keeping them inside?"
"I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of.	That's a bummer, but at least they are trying to avoid you being able to kill them."
"Since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning I realized how badly off I would be if I didn't get an emergency packet together. So that's what I did - cash, water, important documents, a change of clothing.	That sounds like you were prepared for anything! Did it happen in your own home or at work?"
"It was enough to wake me, but not the cat, lol. It just made me realize that the Big One could happen any time and I would have been up the proverbial creek!	That's a good move.  Are you in the habit of carrying extra clothing?"
"Thank you, I will. It's just the price you pay to live in Paradise, right! At least now I won't die of thirst.	I went back to a horse ranch where I owned horses over 20 years ago. Good times	Did you enjoy that?  Were there any horses you didn't see often?  Were there any horses you liked the most?"
"A paint (Black and white) and a red quarter horse	Did the people treating you horses really love them?"
"Horses are hard work but the fun is equal to the work.	The other day I had a flat, but I had my floor jack and 4-way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within 10 minutes.	That is so great! I can just imagine how excited you were."
"I've had so many flats in my life I've gotten quick at changing them.	Thats good, how long did that take?"
"One time, my friends were daring me to jump into a very cold spring from a height of around 40 feet. I was nervous, naturally.	That is pretty tall, did you try it out?  I would have been nervous too."
"Yeah, I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed.	That's insane! How long before people forget this stuff and start calling you names?  Sounds like you'll be around in 20 years!  That's quite an accomplishment!  Did you cry yourself to sleep that night?"
"My dear friend Kris just started a job at a gorgeous golf resort on the shores of Lake Michigan. The green-eyed monster in me wants sooo badly to be there!	That's pretty sweet!  Are you jealous of him?"
"I am, but it's so gorgeous and it's a fantastic golf course. And I'm stuck here, bored stupid! I know, I'm being selfish.	You could look into swing dancing"
"I'm trying. Thank you for making me feel better - I really do wish him great success and happiness.	I'm so excited about an upcoming move and life change -- it's a move to a verrrry different state, but should be interesting!	Where did you move?"
"Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage, to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam, Zurich, and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state, it feels foreign somehow!	Wow that sounds very exciting! Are you moving to an unfamiliar city?"
"I feel so relaxed and at peace when I meditate	That is great, I wish I could mediate."
"No mystic events. I just feel really relaxed and happy.	That is great, I wish I could do that too! Have you had some good guided meditating practices?"
"My traveling is more like a sleep / trance, or hypnosis	Once, I thought somebody was attempting to break into my house.	what!? did you shoot them out of the inside?!?"
"Yes, I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.	Oh wow! That would make my heart skip a beat!"
"I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.	Wow. What was the project over?"
"Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.	It's always disappointing when people bail on a promising thing like that. Especially when the person isn't very good or helpful in anyway shape of, for whatever reason. But, usually those people end up becoming the next Elon Musk."
"I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.	I'm with you on that, it's the biggest stage of the semester. I get very nervous about it!"
"Honestly, I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me.	That sounds stressful, but it sounds like it was way easier in the morning than in the evening."
"I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer, despite being busy with other customers, took the time to take my purchases to my car. What a wonderful, kind man!	That's really nice of the storekeep to help you."
"Not at all. They were super nice, and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy. I love living here - such nice people.	That's really nice of them! I wish I lived in a better town"
"Sure! There's plenty of room, lol. Just be sure you like hot, steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!	I live in Florida. The summers are brutal."
"I get your point - used to live in NE Florida myself. Well, this farmer fella is going to get lots of business from me, that's for sure.	I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn.	I hate wasps. Did you manage to get over it?"
"Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck	I'm sorry that that didn't happen to you. Did it hurt you when it happened?"
"Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!	So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700.	I've done that before... customers are so unreasonable sometimes!"
"Luckily, they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.	That is a terrible situation. UPS is notorious for this kind of thing."
"I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days, when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.	I know what you mean. I think back on those times fondly."
"Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha	I know exactly what you mean, adult life can be stressful at times"
"I love what I do because it's about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs.	Sounds like you're really passionate about what you do! What do your jobs do?"
"I work as a facilitator and team trainer -- mostly with a company who I truly love and respect for walking their talk.	That sounds interesting.  How do you like working there?"
"I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed, frankly.	That's such an honest friend if he forgot to call and wanted to show he still cared."
"I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship!	I think you have to wonder about your friendship as well."
"Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.	People get drunk all the time. If you behave irresponsibly you might lose your seat to someone who isn't fit for power."
"Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while, that's for sure!	I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.	Wow! How much was it?"
"She won $5,000 and never offered to share.	I hate that!  I would have offered too!  That was a tough one to stomach!"
"I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.	Congrats! Sounds like you are commited to school, that's awesome."
"I wouldn't say naturally smart, it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.	That sounds like studying worked out well."
"I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.	When do you think it will be done?"
"Clean up, stabilize from future collapses, demolish vacant houses open closed roads, and so on	That would be quite an undertaking! Would you be laying down or up?"
"I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am, I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me!	That sounds scary! Did you make your friend get away?"
"Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.	Did he do anything to you?  I'm so sorry you had to go through all that.  I hope everything is okay now."
"Well, that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said ""Good morning. Can't sleep either?"" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!	My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.	Aww I am sorry to hear that. I have a one year old and have the same feeling so cross country trips can be helpful! Have you guys been able to find any new places yet?"
"Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?	No I haven't! That is so nice that you felt the need to help her feel better even though you were probably not going to want to move again. It's good that she left you though! She seems like a nice kid"
"I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.	Oh no! What happened? Did you bomb it or not at all?"
"There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also, technical difficulties.	That's always a pain :( I bet you looked pretty miserable."
"Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad!	Why are you glad?"
"Exactly, I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving, which makes things even less safe	i agree with you there, some people just dont care about others"
"I recently got accepted to an Electrical Engineering program at my school.	Wow! That's pretty awesome! I'm sure you'll be a great electric engineering student!"
"I was very excited when I found out. Have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?	No, I haven't been accepted to any engineering school yet. I am applying now"
"I was really frightened the other night. I was home alone and there was a big storm.	Oh my! Was everything alright though, and do you have an underground shelter in case you get scared again?"
"Fortunately, it didn't, but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!	Thank you! storms are scary."
"I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.	What a tragedy."
"Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.	Wow I completely agree. It's one of the main causes of depression I think is the overwhelming amount of factory farming we do. I'm glad he is not dead yet though!"
"It is. I read his book Kitchen Confidential. He's been battling addiction and demons all his life. I thought he'd found peace, but I guess not.	My work supervisor came into my store recently. I tucked in my shirt, left home early, and even put my name badge on for the special occasion.	Did he do anything to you?  Did he make fun of you for it or anything like that."
"I had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! I was on the ball for his visit.	Wow that's so nice of your boss.  Did he give you any big present for coming in so early?"
"I am going to my local amusement park tomorrow and feeling a certain way about it!	amusement parks are fun"
"I am indeed. I am ready to go and ride all of the rides, roller coasters especially! Do you have a favorite theme park?	I do not. I like rollercoasters because they are fun for everyone. Which amusement park are you going too?"
"I recently started putting part of my paychecks into a savings account. I have almost $1000 now.	Wow! How did that work for you?"
"That may take awhile, but for the moment I have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way.	That's really smart! Are you worried that it won't work out?"
"We all were excited when my sister came home for Christmas. She brought her whole family.	Wow. How big was the family?"
"Haha! Nobody ever dresses as Santa, but the kids still believe in Santa which is very fun.	I love the kids! I think they should all dress asSanta!"
"I was very upset when I came home to find that my dog had torn up my living room sofa.	Oh no! I'm sorry that happened to you! Were you able to find out who did it and put them up for adoption!"
"That's horrible, but looking back in the future it will be funny hopefully. My dog I thought had been trained, but she clearly had not!	Dogs are always getting out of control sometimes."
"I think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times.	I can totally relate to you! What shows do you watch/make you feel that? I used to hate dramas and comedies but once I started watching more of a dramas-s shows, I fell in love with the serious shows.  Like, 24/7."
"Everything really, I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before.	I know exactly what you mean. I watch sad shows all the time and when they get real sad it gets hard to take a break."
"Nah, I don't get to to bad.	I am very much looking forward to going to Busch Gardens next week with my family!	Busch Gardens is an amazing place and if it's in the city then it's worth the drive"
"I do too. Did you go to the one in Williamsburg or in Tampa?	The one in Williamsburg is my childhood and I love that park! We are going to the one in Tampa next week. We are super pumped to see it."
"Little kids really have no clue about germs I think.	That's so true. I was just talking about this with my daughter. She had a reaction to one today and had to have it taken away...because she started vomiting."
"This kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it.	Oh no! Kids can be careless when it comes to touching or eating items. Was he able to finish the bar before the kid reached the kid's room?"
"Not even a little.	That's pretty bad luck"
"I can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me. I am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight.	That's really sweet! I have a dog myself."
"Well, right now they both have an ear infection. Both of them are Golden Retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems	That is so wonderful!  Golden retrievers are so precious and gentle dogs.  I love labs though.  How long do you have them?"
"I had a storm come through recently. A massive limb fell on top of my roof and now I have to replace the entire roof of my house	Oh my, that is horrible. I hope everything is okay now."
"It was very bad. The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.	oh god! i'm so sorry! you will be fine though! everything will be alright eventually"
"Yes, insurance will cover it thankfully. I am very lucky.	I went to a wedding. I saw many of my friends from my grade school past.	How was it?  Did you have fun?"
"Yes I do. Some of them I am still very fond of.	That's cool.  Do you have a fondness for all of your childhood friends as well?"
"I can't wait for my family to come to town. My house is all in order for when they come.	That's nice. I hope they enjoy it? Do you have a large house?"
"No, I really don't so it's special. I would have what many would call a nuclear family, you know?	Wow, that would sound amazing, having your family come to you as well. You're lucky"
"I went to my friend's niece's dance recital this weekend. I could not believe how well she did.	That's awesome! Did you have fun seeing her perform?"
"She is very young, and she stole the show. She was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls.	That's awesome! I wish i could dance like that!"
"You know you could still do it. I know you can.	Thanks, that's a good encouraging advice! Do you have any advice to give to make myself feel less bad about myself in the future?"
"My son drove down and spent the whole weekend helping me move.	Wow! That's so nice of him! You must really love him!"
"He lives about a couple hours away, but he's young and always busy. I was very relieved to have some help as it was a BIG job!	Wow that's very nice of him. He's lucky to have a son who loves helping."
"You know sometimes when you just feel like you have to leave a job? Well, that time is now for me and I can not wait for my job interview this week.	I hope you do well and get the job!"
"It is so tempting you're absolutely right. I'm going to try and hang on though, and thanks for the advice.	You should do your best, just don't stress about it too much. You have no idea what kind of person your going to meet at the interview, but it's their call."
"I found a salad in the back of my refrigerator that I forgot about. It smelled awful when I opened the container it was in.	I bet you were super grossed out!"
"Yes, it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.	Well it's good that it didn't. Most of us don't know what a refrigerator is."
"Thanks for that information. I'll try it out.	Last year my sister opened up her own retail store. It is doing very well, and I love going to see it.	What store is it?"
"It has a lot of quirky things that most Big Box stores don't carry. It has everything from clothes for all ages, to jewelry and lots of other things.	What stores in that area do you like? Sounds fun!"
"I have another job so I can't do too much, but I love going in to see her.	That sounds fun! I hope it turns out that you are a jewelry hoarder aswell!"
"I felt very isolated when we first moved to Hong Kong -- I had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!	I am sorry that that was hard for you. You should try to find a job and also look for a holiday home."
"It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!	Wow that's awesome. I'm happy you have that supportive community. I'm guessing you also feel like that in other places?"
"Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!	I'm so excited for you! I moved last year to Amsterdam. It was truly a magical experience!"
"I recently got very sick, and I had to spend a lot of time in the hospital. I am very lucky that I have a great family that watched over me.	That's unfortunate. It must have been very scary."
"Not a day goes by where I'm not thankful. I'm still recovering and they are still there for me.	That's really great you have a great family. It's good you had someone to lean on."
"I find it profoundly sad and disturbing how some people will rationalize someone else's unhinged behavior, simply to avoid admitting that maybe they made a horrible choice.	I agree. It is a disturbing thing that people can behave in such a cruel way, when they don't have control over their own lives"
"We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!	I really agree.  It's so easy to see the bad people as people we can help, but it's sad how that turns out sometimes"
"Me too! <fist bump> ;-)	So yesterday I found out my roommate has been dating someone for 3 months. I can't believe he didn't tell me.	Did you tell them?"
"He is usually a very private person. He hasn't dated anyone in the over 3 years i've lived here, and he's only ever had one friend over.	3 months? Wow that is a long time to break up so..."
"I got so annoyed the other day. Got cut off in traffic.	Did anyone step out?"
"I agree! Do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?	I agree. People just don't understand why we can't have nice things sometimes!"
"You know my parents still have not gotten over the loss of my sister.	That sucks"
"She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.	I'm so sorry to hear about that; my parents are getting old. My sister was just over 50 and lived with her parents for the first time until she passed at the age of 50. Your parents must be very sad."
"I will, and thank you so much for the encouragement.	I've been passively job hunting for a few months now, looking for a better job. I haven't had any luck yet and I'm starting to feel like I never will.	Oh I'm sorry. What have you been doing."
"Well I don't have any friends that are in my field or even close to it. I'm trying the best I can and am trying to find other ways to make money too.	What do you do?  Sounds hard!  Do you have a day job?"
"One of my much younger sister's is starting college in a couple weeks. I am so excited for her.	I bet you are!  What is she going to school for?"
"She told me she wants to become a dentist, but she's a little fickle. I will see what she says she wants to do in a year.	What is a little ""fickle"" haha. Has she decided what her major is yet?"
"June and July are very busy, June I prep plans for July. July I have company all month.	Why do you have to do your co-workers in such busyness?"
"So much for relaxing during the summer?	I'm July and August here.  The summer just ended, and it'll be July here for a little while longer.  Did you have any plans for the month of August?"
"Do you even know how crazy it is to skydive? I must have been absolutely nuts when I did it.	I think it's crazy enough to be fun. I'm not really sure about it, but it would certainly be an exercise for the mind!"
"It gave me the biggest rush that's for sure. But on the way down I was saying my prayers.	Oh man, I've always wanted to skydive. Would it be worth it to do it on my first try?"
"You should do it sometime. It's fun to take chances.	I agree, I try and do that even when I feel absolutely sure I can do it."
"I have recently become vegan and I am very impressed with the food	That's awesome! I'm glad you're getting back in the game."
"I had to start eating this way because of health reasons and I have found some amazing recipes on Pinterest.   It makes me not miss meat or dairy at all	That is good, do you use pesticides when you cook?"
"I have to get these shots in my head for migraines.	That is such bad luck. How do you think you will do in those pictures?"
"oh man that sounds like serious stuff ,and it sounds really scary as well hope everything goes great	When my mom had breast cancer a few years ago. I wanted to do everything I could to be there for her.	That's so sad. Did she have a nice family?"
"I was and she was had a full recovery.	I bet you were a strong and supporting parent."
"Me neither, my mom means so much to me.	wow thats great!"
"Do you get to see your mom often?	No i dont, why?"
"I saw a dodge viper in the parking lot yesterday. Probably one of the coolest American made cars!	Cool. What year>?"
"It was blue with white racing stripes.	Cool! Have you gone for a ride in it?"
"Same here, they are pretty expensive.	My dog chewed up one of my flip flops the other day. Now I have to throw them out.	That is no good, did you have them for long?"
"This is the first one she tore up. My roommate was watching her while I was out of town. I'm sorry about your shoes.	That's too bad but at least you can put them on a cart and take a trip away"
"My wife surprised me on my birthday with an amazing homemade dinner.	What was it"
"She made me ribs and a cheesecake for dessert.	That sounds amazing."
"Thank you! What is your favorite meal?	That sounds so good right now! What did you end up getting?"
"Me too, do you have a favorite flavor?	My long term boyfriend and I broke up recently. I'm so lost right now.	Sorry to hear about your loss, but I hope things start back up soon."
"I know, it's just so frustrating after spending so long building your lives together.	I'm so sorry. That is so sad to hear. Are you thinking of getting him a second partner?"
"My grandfather invited me over and made us an awesome dinner today. I was so hungry.	That sounds so awesome! Was it your birthday?"
"He made us a pot roast with carrots and potatoes. It's melt in your mouth good.	Cool, what was the occasion? Did he tell you his plans for the dinner?"
"I got a promotion in work. I am so excited for the raise and added responsibility.	Congratulations! I'm happy for you!"
"Thank you, I am so excited. It has taken 3 years of hard work to earn this promotion.	Congratulation! I'm sure you deserved it!"
"I work in the military	My daughter can say so many new words, love to see her thrive!	That's awesome! What kind of words does she have?"
"Yes, thank you! Having children is a wonderfull blessing. Couldn't imagine my life without my daughter. Do you have children?	I don't. I have three kids, though"
"I've got all of my bags packed, passport ready, and i'm not even leaving for vacation until next week.	where are you going? are you scared to go?"
"I'm going to Japan. I'm so excited, I've never been.	Wow, that's pretty early to go. Are you going by yourself?"
"So my parents took me out to dinner for my birthday tonight.	Oh that sounds like a good surprise! Did you have something good?"
"Thanks! I had an awesome time. I went to a sushi place and it was delicious.	I love sushi! I go to the sushi buffet at my college almost every day"
"I did indeed. Along with every other kind of roll that they had, haha.	Oh yeah, I love sushi! I'm so jealous right now! I'm thinking about visiting one myself, they seem pretty cool."
"So yesterday I went for a bike ride in my city's park. The weather was perfect!	That's nice! What weather did you have?"
"It was wonderful. I felt at peace as I rode by all of the flower gardens and fountains. Do you visit any parks or gardens in your area?	I have a garden. I visit many parks. I do not like the path/bike lanes/parking where people walk in circles waiting to put something down. I don't like people not wanting to walk on grass or loose stones/ Anything that isn't green."
"It's so quiet in my house, just watching tv by myself. Wish my family was around.	You must like to just be alone!"
"That is a great attitude to have, my husband is in the military so he is gone a lot to other countries. My family is about 2,000 miles away in Alaska!	wow that sounds very lonely"
"Whenever we moved abroad, I learned to trust my instinct and sense of adventure.	That's so awesome! How far did you move?"
"Ah -- thank you! Definitely aware of wanting to live life to its fullest. We've recently gone through a tough time, so it feels lovely to focus on adventure again.	I bet it does! Are you in a foreign country right now?"
"Bless you! What a *relief* and how impressive! We've lived in Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Zurich -- Alaska may be next. (And Italy is awesome, by the way!)	It's my brother's 16th birthday in a couple days and he's probably getting a nicer car than I currently have. I'm 24.	oh thats cool"
"I certainly am! Of course, I can't be certain yet because I don't know what he's getting. My car is junk though so it's bound to be better.	I am sure the 16th will be a fine car"
"So my brother is turning 16 soon which means I don't have to drive him around anymore. Score!	That's great! 16 isn't that old to drive."
"Yes indeed! I am very happy about it. Do you have any younger siblings?	I do have one, but shes only 15.  We get carpool tickets to work sometimes lol."
"I saw somebody I hadn't in years. It was a nice meeting.	What did they do to surprise you so unexpectedly?"
"Yes it is. I am glad that I was able to speak with her.	What did she like most about you?"
"I love the adventure and perspective of living away from my home state -- but that doesn't mean I don't miss elements of it while I'm gone!	What kind of elements do you miss most?"
"Are you able to visit often? That helps -- but it's funny how things never feel *exactly* the same, you know?	I am sure. Do you live in the midwest. I have family down there but moved away for college. I live in the southeast now"
"I went to a bar a couple days ago and was hit on by a woman.	How'd she do that?"
"I respectfully told her I was not interested, I already have a wife so I need to be committed. I would never cheat.	That is very nice of you. You are married too?"
"I recently attended a play. My friend's acting was significant!	What play was it? Did you enjoy yourself? Did you know the play was happening?"
"I am very glad that I went and supported him.	That's cool! I like supporting my favorite actors too!  Did he have an awesome role?"
"Sometimes when I'm driving home after a holiday, such as christmas, I get an overwhelming sense of being alone.	Maybe try having a night alone?"
"No I haven't, but that's a decent idea that I may try. Thanks for the suggestion!	Maybe you could go somewhere public like a store parking lot to meet people."
"So I recently made buffalo wing sauce from a new recipe I found and it turned out great!	Cool, I like wings. What did you search for?"
"Me too! It only took 10 minutes to make and now I feel way more sure of myself when making it next time.	That's awesome! wing sauce is one of my favorites too! I'm glad you were able to find something new and creative to make.  Did you make it up off the bag?"
"I recently completed some additional training at my job. Perhaps a promotion is on its' way?	I hope so!  That sounds exciting!  What did you train for?"
"Indeed. I feel that it is very important to stay caught up on the latest developments. And the potential for a raise isn't a bad motivator either.	I am sure it was all worth the wait!!"
"I am so excited for my baby son to be born, I am so eager for it to happen!	That is great. Is this your first child?"
"I know! Hopefully the stress levels are kept to a minimal and I have a very supporting husband who will be there every step of the way. I hope for a swift and trouble free birth.	That is awesome! I am very sure you are an amazing mother! I am so glad your son is here!"
"So last night I was watching scary videos on youtube while home alone.	Oh yeah? Did it get a good scare or what?"
"Yes, I had kind of an eerie and generally unsettling feeling. I wondered why I did that in the first place. Can you relate?	i have had that feeling before"
"I'm ready for football season to start, NFL preseason started this week, and I can't wait for regular season and I'm really looking forward to the NCAA kickoff!	I remember the first professional season I ever attended. I went to a preseason football game in College Park in Georgia. What side are you rooting for?"
"In NFL it's the Packers and college is Alabama	Oh nice.  I don't really follow the college game much.  Are you a big fan?"
"I visited the BMX park today and saw someone doing a double front flip with their bike, it was insane!	that sounds like fun! i haven't been to an amusement park in years."
"I agree, years of experience and a lot of guts are needed. You could easily get injured but he pulled it off. It was crazy to see it in person. It's the type of stuff you see on TV	It's like they were skating on air!  That's pretty amazing!"
"My car broke down yesterday but luckily my friend was able to pick me up from work while it was in the shop. I think I'm going to take him to a nice restaurant to say thanks.	That was incredibly nice of you!  I hope your friend appreciates it!"
"It was just the carburetor, which is supposed to be an easy fix. I'm so glad I wasn't stranded at my office.	That's good. I had a car mechanic say that the carburetor was something that he had to replace."
"I was so set on getting an A on my math test that I studied so hard to do good on it. I studied for days!	Awww that stinks but hey, better be over prepared!"
"I ended up getting an A actually. It was exactly what I wanted to get.	Math is pretty tough, glad you got an A!"
"My friend passed away in a car crash a couple days ago, I'm still in shock.	OH no. How old was he?"
"They've been really closed up about the whole thing, I can't contact them or anything. They must be going through a tough time, I could not imagine.	I'm really sorry.  What kind of crash was it?"
"I realized yesterday I was pregnant, I was in shock!	Wow congratulations! How are you celebrating?"
"I am still in awe, I think things will turn out fine but it was definitely not expected.	Wow congratulations! When did you find out?"
"When the weather was getting bad and it rained hard in our area, I was ready for the flooding that was going to happen in our neighborhood.	Oh wow! How did you and everyone you knew take precautions?"
"I had an emergency generator, extra food and first aid kits at the ready. I did not want my family in danger.	That's a good attitude. You're very brave!"
"I stole a candy and drink from the gas station once, I felt terrible about the whole ordeal.	Why gas station? Did someone offer to buy you more?"
"I was 17, at that age I should of known better.	Did it make you feel better though"
"My friend has had the flu, and I have been making sure they get better and that they eat.	That's really kind of you. Is he going to be better and better for it?"
"Aw thank you. He seems to be recovering pretty well, just whiny.	That's good that they seem to be in a good mood, though! I hope the flu stays away from him forever!"
"I managed to get on the A honor roll at my school, I was a bit smug and happy for myself about the whole thing.	Wow, you must have worked hard."
"I'm just happy that I got it, it took a lot of hard work.	That is great, I bet it was a lot of hard work to earn it!"
"The last time I hung out with a group of friends before moving we watched this really terrible movie.	That sucks! Sorry to hear it was a bad movie for you and friends"
"Yeah, it was fun.  We ended up making the best of it, making fun of the movie while it was on.	Sounds like a fun time! Did you watch it with anyone special?"
"I remember sitting in the waiting room before my last job interview.  I was sweating and couldn't stop my leg from shaking.	I remember those nervous moments. Was your interviewer nice?"
"The interview went well and I ended up getting the job, so I guess I worried for nothing :)	Congrats! I'm sure you were nervous, but you did great! It's a great feeling when your hard work pays off!"
"The other day I had to take my dogs out before work, but my neighbor was right outside with her aggressive yappy dog smoking so I couldn't get out.	That's too bad.  I'm glad the dogs are okay though!"
"She usually cares enough to at least time her cigarettes so they don't get in the way with things like work, but not this time.	That's really nice that your neighbor cares so much about your safety! I'm sorry you had to experience that, but I'm happy to here that your neighbor cares about your safety!"
"I was at a pizza joint and my chair leg broke and I fell to the floor. Everyone in the pizza place all was looking at me on the floor. My face was so red and the manager came over and helped me up.	I hope it wasn't a bad injury that kept him from ordering you to the bathroom."
"Now I can laugh, but when I was on the floor I was not laughing, I just wanted to leave.	That's funny! I would feel the same as laughing myself off."
"My son is 16 months and he finally learned how to use a spoon and a fork. I've been trying to teach him for a couple of months!	That's wonderful. My daughter is only 5 months old. She loves to use the spoon!"
"He is still very messy but he really enjoys eating like a big boy	That is great. My daughter is 3 1/2 months and learn to use a spatula and a bowl as well."
"When my wife and I started dating, our second date ended up lasting like 12 hours.	why so long?"
"Lunch, a zoo, my apartment for a while, and a movie and dinner.  We just didn't want to go home for the night :P	Oh no! That sounds awful!"
"Years ago my childhood beagle died from kidney failure.  I found him in the kitchen in the morning, he did not go easily :(	Beagles are some tough pets. I had one die from congestive heart failure when I was a kid."
"Yeah, he had diabetes for a few years by that point.  It was just a rough way to go and I hope it didn't take very long.	That beagle was probably my favorite dog ever. I'm sorry."
"I remember getting my first job and just working so hard for that first week cause it was retail	I remember those days too! Did you find one after that long period of time working?"
"Oh man the thing that got me was waiting for the first check to come in though. Remember that? You're very FIRST one	Oh yea, that feeling is always different though."
"I realized that my bus that I ride to work in every day is a revamped school bus	Thats cool. Do you have any cool kids pictures of the old days on there?"
"Oh god no thankfully I have fond memories of it. I just realized how cheap the company is!	Wow that's really cheap especially for an old bus system!  I'm sorry it isn't in better shape anymore"
"I broke up with my girlfriend last week and it was really hard	I know how you feel.  How are you holding up?"
"Yeah we where together for about 2 years but im getting over it now	I'm so sorry to hear about that. It's good to be over that though."
"I was out at dinner with my family, and when coming back to the table from the bathroom I somehow accidentally sat down with a different family.	Oh no!  Did they react the same?"
"Yeah, it certainly lead to a lot of good natured ribbing from my parents :P	haha that's a good one."
"We are getting our son to go back to college in a few days and it really made me stop and think back to him when he was smaller, and how time flies by so fast!	Yes it does! I also have a son and it flies by too fast too!"
"I know, that's about how I felt too! I think back to when he was much smaller and how adorable he was when he would call me mommy then!	Aww, you are so right about that time! Life really flies by fast doesn't it? I am happy you will have that to look back on as well."
"The last time I went to the fair, I tripped and fell. There were so many people around that saw me hit the ground. You can imagine how I felt!	Oh god! Are you ok?"
"I scuffed my knees a bit, but I was okay. I was also with a person that I really liked, so that made it even worse. But, I jumped up super quick lol	I tripped at the fair not too long ago too. I dont tripped too much"
"i stold some spare change from my parents	That was nice of you."
"maybe like 19, but i felt bad after so i invited them to dinner	I think you did a good thing by doing that."
"Yeah i told them as well	My sister passed away several years ago. I really had a hard time with the grief and couldn't really relate to anyone that tried to help me with it.	I am very sorry to hear about that.  I have lost both my grandparents within the last year, so I know the feeling very well"
"Yes, I'm sure you can relate as well. Ironically, that was the same age that my sister passed away. She took her own life, which my mother and I found her, and it was very hard for us all. But, I couldn't burden my parents with my pain, I felt.	I'm glad you understand. I don't have family to carry with me, so I understand completely, what your saying."
"Having a good job is something to thank	I agree. I have been there and know that it is not easy to accomplish.  It is something we should all be thankful for."
"to life God to that higher energy	I agree with that. I feel grateful towards my husband for getting his degree and helping out with bills."
"Nobody ... that's why I'm grateful	I am grateful as well"
"I'm an administrative assistant for a construction company	Wow, thank you for what your position brings you, I wish there were more people like you in this world"
"I was devastated when I lost my phone	I am sorry to hear that. Do you have another phone that you could try to find?"
"I did but it took a while	I'm so sorry to hear about that. Did you manage to find it or at least remember what you had lost it too?"
"I was surprised when my family threw me a surprise party	Where were the parties at? Was it at your house or at school?"
"I turned 34	Wow! Where was it?"
"i didn't see my parents since 2014! I miss them so much. it's so sad that i live in a different country	That is really sad. Where did you move to after you graduate?"
"actually in 2 weeks! I'm so excited about it. I'm going there with my son! They've never met him	that's awesome that your son is going visit them! i bet that is going to be so fun"
"I was annoyed when my favorite show wasn't on	What show is that?"
"I ended up watching Impractical Jokers	I've never watched it but it sounds good.  What is it about?"
"I love when I need to show someone how to do something and everything goes off without a hitch.	Sometime that's the most satisfying!"
"Fortunately it's usually just not having the best answer for what they ask. I've learned and prepared a lot more this time.	It's good you took steps to improve your answers."
"I tend to know a thing or two on occasion.	I am taking a long overdue and much needed vacation this week. I wish i didnt have to fly.	Where are you headed to? Are you going on your vacation home?"
"I usually do pretty good on short flights. Longer ones make me a little nervous.	I take those vacations too. Why are you nervous?"
"I hate turbulence too.	I didnt think to invite my sister to a party I recently helped put on.	Oh no! Was something up with your sister?"
"No she wasnt. In all fairness it was a group of people I never would have thought she would have wanted to hang out with.	That was nice. How long ago did you help her?"
"you are right. Guess I know better for next time.	My sunday was great. All my chores were done ahead of time. It was a rare and welcomed day.	Thats great!  You must have felt very happy!"
"I wish I could more often, but it rarely happens. Especially during the summer. My yard grows like literal weeds.	I am glad it was a nice surprise. Do they do it on special occasions too?"
"ouch! I would not have had a relaxing sunday if my yard was that way.	I'm with you on that one! My yard is straight garbage and it's so hot."
"My husband has to travel a lot for work. It can be hard on a marriage, but after almost 23 years of marriage, I have faith he is loyal and faithful when he does.	Oh that's too bad, are they going to have a baby?"
"He is an iron worker, so he has to go state to state at times to build very large buildings.	That's so cool, I work from home and I love ironworkers.  You must work really hard."
"I've been married almost 23 years, but many years ago, my husband was acting a bit too ""chivalrous"" to a female acquaintance of ours. He said he was only being nice, but I felt he was being a bit 'too nice', which made me feel a bit upset.	Oh no that is too interesting! I'm glad you guys are adults about it instead of just little kids!"
"Well, we really didn't know her very well and she actually just came to one of our friends house while we were there, and she was intoxicated. He was trying to help her get up and situated, but he was very insistent about it, even when she didn't want help. It looked bad to others.	Oh no! I am glad he didn't make you feel that way, but please don't ever let it make you think he was being rude to the woman. That's what he gets you when you don't fully appreciate or trust someone. I hope he left her a little bit charasmatic."
"My niece is super talented lately.	awww.. what happened"
"Art, she was accepted into a special program for high school.	What kind of program?"
"Mostly drawing. And she's in advanced level classes in most subjects.	One day my 10 year old daughter came home crying after she got off the bus. A teenage boy purposely tripped her as she was getting off and she got hurt. Needless to say, I was very, very upset!	That's terrible!  Poor innocent kid!  Did he get in trouble?"
"I actually knew his father, so I called and spoke to him about it. I let him know that if it happened again, I couldn't promise her big brother wouldn't take it in his own hands to defend her, as he wasn't okay with anyone bullying her.	That's very kind of you!  Sometimes the most important thing is to teach your own children how to be healthy and to defend themselves."
"I really dont like my husbands job right now.	That's unfortunate. What is it that he does that is so hard?"
"Retail, but he's working nights at a store really far away and it sucks	That stinks. I'm sure if you tell him he'll find another job, but you still have to be really supportive."
"We are hoping with in a few months.	Each year my husband usually gets a bonus this month or next. It's not promised, but it has happened for several years now. I am really wishing it will be this year too!	That's so awesome! What does he get usually?"
"Well, we have college tuition, just got back from an expensive beach vacation, etc. So, if anything replenish some savings, right!	I think you need more wishes!  My parents are on their 60s and 70s, respectively.  Perhaps you and he should get bonuses every month just to keep things interesting ha!"
"I hate watching movies that are full of gore! I just saw one today and so gross!	What was the movie? Geez"
"Yes, I was just flipping through the channels and happened upon a man cutting his own leg off. yuck!	Oh my god, you just described my worst nightmare! How can people cut their legs off?? I thought they were so cute the first time I ever saw them in real life!!"
"My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!	How much is he getting?"
"My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!	Why don't your husband get a large bonus?"
"He is a welder and iron worker, so he works very hard all year long and does extensive amounts of travel. He has earned it!	I've been married a long time, but my husband is gone quite a bit for work. I feel a bit by myself at times because of this :(	Aw, that's a bummer. Do you at least get to visit?"
"Luckily, my children still live at home, but it's not quite the same. Plus, it won't be too long before they are ready to move out	Oh wow. That's really good that you guys are close and able to communicate. I hope you guys can laugh and bevieve all you want in order to accomplish that goal! :)"
"My youngest child started high school this year. It really made me think back to her starting kindergarten, and how time really goes by. I can just see her learning to read!	I can just imagine! It is so cool to see them grow up, learning from us and helping others. It makes you wish you had children myself."
"Yes, it really is bittersweet. But, the older they get, the easier it is to think back to the younger days!	I can totally understand that.  It's a shame the way our technology and ageistically accelerated society prevents us from realising the wisdom of the ages"
"I was so scared when i heard a gunshot sound while i was walking through the streets the other day	Oh my god. Was it a police or a robber?"
"No, i felt it would be better if i dont go looking for it. i managed to get the hell out of there	Oh my gosh, I bet you are scared all the time. What do you think was it?"
"I feel so sad whenever thoughts about my dad come to me, he passed away last year	I'm so sorry to hear about that.  I know it's hard, losing a loved one, but think of all the positive aspects!  You can find peace when thinking of him, and I'm sure you'll feel better."
"He had terminal stage brain cancer.. we did all we could, but..	I'm so sorry. I'm thinking about you right now. Do you want to talk?"
"i felt really good about myself when i got a new job at a reputed firm	That's great! What kind of job is it and what are you looking for?"
"i was so angry when i found out my girlfriend kissed a friend of mine	I'm sorry, how long have they been friends?"
"i have not confronted them. still thinking about it	Why did they do it? Is it something that can be forgiven."
"I went to the beach last week	Was it nice?"
"yeah. so much memories of me and family spending time in beach came to me	I've never been but i hear so many good things! was there a lot to do or just so so much to see?"
"I was so furious when i found out a coworker badmouthed me to my boss	Really? Why was that?"
"Yeah. i outperform this person, and he started throwing shade on me out of pure jealousy	That's terrible, I feel bad when people do things to me."
"I went to see Hamilton last month in NYC	How did it go.I have never seen a musical."
"It was such a stunning show. Lin manuel should get a grammy for this	He was definitely not expecting to win, that is a fact"
"I was so ashamed when i threw up in public the other day	That would be embarassing! Are you ok?"
"Yeah, i felt like i was coming down with something. i rushed to get a cab, but i couldn't help it	ugh that's the worst,  Was it something that was easily replaced?"
"My girlfriend asked me to meet her parents next week	Have yo meet them yet/"
"I am not sure to be honest. i am feeling so nervous about it	I am sure that is a good decision. Are you going with anyone?"
"i felt betrayed when my girlfriend kissed another guy at a party	Oh my god. Why did she do that?"
"Nothing. She was drunk, so i let it go. I still feel disappointed	Sometimes people make mistakes like that, and regret them later. If it's any condolence, you can still give them a taste of your own medicine to help things get better."
"I was really upset when my daughter went into labor and I couldn't be there.	I can't imagine not being able to see your daughter. That must have been awful"
"She lives in another state and wasn't due for several more months. Everyone is fine now though, so it has turned out to be very joyous.	That's awesome. How far along is she?"
"I was in total shock the night my fiance proposed to me at a concert.	propose to me? how come? what was the occasion?"
"They started playing one of our special songs and the next think I knew he was down on one knee. I said yes, of course!	You may have just surprised him a little bit. That is a pretty awesome gift to receive - a man that's willing and Able to take a surprising turn in life :) Congratulations on your engagement."
"I admire my boss because he does not act like a boss. He acts more like a friend and he is so down to earth.	Sounds like a nice guy to have around. I wish I had a boss like that."
"He is not just friendly, he is a good leader and knows how to treat his workers.	Those are good traits to have.  Most people don't take that kind of position."
"I remember when I was a kid and in the summertime I used to catch fireflies and place them in a jar by my bedside at night.	I have always tried to do this, but it always get me too excited and on edge when I do it. What do you do in the summer time?"
"The fireflies would blink in the jar all night long.	Wow! How long did it take you to stop?"
"I'm so tired this morning, I went to bed early, but it seems when I go to bed early I wake up more tired. It aggravates me!	I know the feeling! Have you thought about getting some sleep earlier?"
"I hate it! I feel more energized when I get 4 hours of sleep than I do when I get 8!	I feel you there, I have that happen to me often."
"I'm in contract to buy my first house, fingers crossed closing goes well and I close next Friday!	That's exciting! I'm sure closing will be smooth."
"I'm definitely excited. The house just now got built and I saw it for the first time last Monday.	I hope all goes well. I know how anxious that can make you!"
"My Mother and I made plans to hang out and do lunch this past week.	Did she get in trouble for not telling you when she was going to have dinner with family?"
"Unfortunately she was unable to make it because her diabetes is wreking her health.	I am sorry to hear this. Is there any way for her to make it at some point?"
"I am feeling bad because my grandchild wants me to play all the time but I have to work a lot.	I am sorry, work does have its time. Life is just too short! Maybe you can work remote to have more time to spend with your child."
"She doesn't understand why I always have so many other things to do, but she would literally play 24/7 if I had the time.	I feel your pain. My son is the same way, only he doesn't want me to ride the coasters lol"
"My four year old daughter came to me beaming with pride and showing me a drawing she did of me.	That is adorable. How old is she now?"
"I was really surpised.  I expected a stick figure, but she drew a lot of features including my beard and mustache.	oh that must be so cool, do you get to talk to your daughter often, maybe we can see eye to eye?"
"I had to run some errands.  While gone I instructed my older daughters to complete some math assignments.	Did the girls do well?"
"When I returned I found them playing video games, the math work was not even attempted.  I tunred their stuff off and we did it together.	That's wonderful!Math is really hard, I couldn't imagine doing it alone!"
"A recruiter contacted me the other day about potential job openings, so I'm hoping I may have a job soon!	What kind of job?"
"Me too. I've been dying to get out of my current job, but having a recruiter makes me feel at ease.	I'm sure it's good you're looking for something so simple yet rewarding. I hope everything works out."
"I found a box of old photos in my closet yesterday.	Were they from your childhood?"
"A lot of them where photos of my sister and I when we were toddlers.  It was a good trip down memory lane.	Those memories are sometimes the best.   Were they photos of your family or friends?"
"I was disgusted when my dad left me	Why did he leave?"
"I'm not sure. I guess he just didn't want anything to do with me.	What happened?"
"I have been rehearsing for a job interview for a couple of weeks now, and I am so ready!	Oh wow! Have you been doing it for a while? Do you feel prepared?"
"I don't normally prepare for interviews, but I really want this job, so I put in a lot of practice.	What kind of job is it for?"
"I went to the fride and was surprised to find what I thought was an ice cream cake.	Creme frappacinos are amazing!"
"It turned out to not even be an ice cream cake.  It was some kind of pinapple cake.  I still had a piece but it was disappointing.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you eat the whole thing?"
"I was surprised when my wife left me	why is that"
"We were married for 10 years	Aww, that's so sad. Why did she leave you?"
"I was annoyed when my family missed my birthday	Why did they miss your birthday?"
"Yeah that's very true. Doesn't mean we aren't important though	Well, obviously, we are. But, we can still enjoy our time together. I guess."
"Interestingly, I also had a job interview recently, although I've already heard back and I got it!	How exciting! Do you feel like it went well?"
"A lab manager for a Physics department at a University.	Thats awesome. You are very lucky."
"I had a terrifying experience what using the restroom yesterday.	Oh my!  What happened??"
"As I was sitting on the toilet I kept hearing a scratching noise.  When I turned to look a huge waterbug had climbed up the tub wall next to me.	I would have screamed!"
"When I was younger, my dad got into a motor cycle accident. It made me not want to learn how to drive for almost 2 years.	Oh no! That is scary! I can imagine it must have really messed you up."
"I did learn, but it took a long time to overcome my fear. I'm glad I eventually did!	Good for you. I still don't know how to ride a bike."
"I had to replace my toilet the other day.  It was a new experience, and not altogether pleasant.	Oh, wow! What was wrong with it?"
"Yeah.  It wasn't terribly hard, but it definitely took watching a few videos to feel confident.	Oh I have had those replace before. They take like 5 minutes at most. Not a big deal."
"In college I was in a class with an older woman who stole my ideas for a paper.	How old was she really"
"It's ok.  I'm basically over it now, but it was really angering then.	Why do people think they can steal things just to make a buck?"
"I was grateful when I married my wife	i am glad you married her! it's always a blessing and a curse"
"We met at a store	That is great. I am glad you married a wonderful partner."
"When I was in college an older woman in a class of mine stole my ideas for a paper.	That is horrible!  What did you do after she stole your ideas?"
"Well, ranted about it to my girlfriend for a while then talked to the professor to make it clear what she did.	Oh, how did you reacted?"
"My family and I are close to aquiring a new home.	Are you excited about it?"
"IIt is an older home in need of some repairs.  We can't wait to get started on renovations.	That sounds cool. I like the sound of it, it's a good feeling to be in a new place and feel like you have a place to call home"
"I was excited when I bought my car	I would have been too! What kind of car did you get?"
"It was a mustang. I saved up enough money and purchased it outright	Mustang is an awesome car."
"I was fast asleep this morning when my cat pounced on me and jolted me awake.	Cats can be ridiculous! Was it a cat that you saw?"
"It came out of nowhere. I almost fell out of bed!	That is so funny! Poor cat!"
"I'm feeling a little down right now. The weather is perfect, but I miss not going to the beach with my husband and dog and catching the sunset. Those were great times!	I know what you mean. I'm in the exact same boat. At least we have the sun to thank for our vitamin D."
"Yeah, we would take a bottle of wine with us, watch the surfers and just kick back. Wish those days would return.	I feel ya. Atleast its raining wine. Maybe one day we will be able to go on a vacation haha!"
"Maybe one day. That was when I lived in Northern California - the best place on the planet, imho!	I am confident that I will win that spelling bee tomorrow	wow, you are so confident, you must have studied hard for it"
"I have. I've studied for 3 week now	wow. you must be pretty confident. what makes you so confident?"
"I've been trying lately to potty train my youngest daughter.	Nice! How far in the past have you gotten her?"
"It's been a challenge.  Yesterday she got on the toilet herself though.  She said she didn't want to be a baby anymore.	Aww, that's sad but it's a part of life I guess."
"My wife has been out of the country for school for a while.  Dropping her off at the airport was really hard.	how long will it take her to get back?"
"Yeah, we talk by text all the time and call every day.  It's still hard though, we haven't been apart longer than a couple days since we met.	Aww, that's hard! How long will it be for before she gets back?"
"I was sad when my dog died	I'm sorry to hear that! How old was your dog?"
"Its ok. It's just been rough without him. I miss him	I am so sorry for your loss. How long did you have him?"
"My wife is coming home after being out of the country for 2 months.  I can't wait!	Where was she gone?"
"I am!  We've never been apart this long, so it's been tough.	That's awesome! I hope everything goes well for you and congratulations on 2 months!"
"I was afraid when I watched a horror film	Horrible movies give me so much anxiety! Were you scared by a particular movie or just the overall feeling?"
"Some have pop ups and they are creepy	I do not like scary movies"
"I'm going on vacation for the first time in several years!	That's awesome! Where ya headed?"
"I'm taking a cruise to Alaska. I'm soooo excited.	Wow, that's an amazing accomplishment! Where are you going for vacation?"
"My wife is coming back into the country at the end of the weeks after 2 months away.  I can't wait!	That's great!  Where are y'all going?"
"Germany for a language course.	wow. that will be fun"
"I was prepared for tonights big dinner	What did your guests eat?"
"It's going to be at my house. We are going to have a lot of food	What are you cooking up? I love trying out new things!"
"I was terrified when I watched that horror movie	Was it that scary?"
"It was Scream	Did you enjoy it>"
"I was digging through some old stuff I had and I found letters that my wife wrote me when we were still dating. They were so sweet.	Wow that's really cool, how long were they you looking for them?"
"Yeah! It gave me all of the feels. I read through them and pretty much fell in love with her all over again.	That is awesome!  What did you write each letter for?"
"I managed to spook myself really bad once watching too many horror movies and being in a house alone by the woods.	Oh no! I do that way too often! What happened afterwards?"
"Yeah.  I kept thinking trees were people or things standing out in the woods.	Yeah I get that way sometimes when im alone.  Were they really bad movies?"
"I'm so proud of my wife	Why are you so proud?"
"She really is	That is a very nice thing to say!"
"I was angry when my son destroyed my car	How did he destroy it?"
"no not salvagable. i had to buy a new one.	Wow that sucks! Did he just wreck it, and not even take credit for it?"
"its okay. gave me an opportunity for a new adventure	I'm starting a new job next week, and while I am excited, I am also very nervous!	What job are you starting?  I am very sure that you are excited but I am not positive.  I am sure you will do fine though."
"That's true, but the uncertainty always makes me feel a bit nervous.	I'm sure you will do fine! Do you start right away?"
"I had to go out of town and leave my dogs with a friend, I was worried about them.	Oh yeah? Why were you worried about them?"
"Yeah.  They annoyed my friend some, but overall it was fine.	Oh no that's too far. How far are they gone?"
"My wife has been in Germany for 2 months.  I can't wait till she gets home.	What are you doing there then?"
"It sucks, but it's best to keep busy with whatever you can.  Videogames helped a lot :P	What is a videogame?"
"My wife has been out of the country for 2 months.  She's coming back soon, but it's been tough without her.	Where did she land ya"
"I'm looking forward to it :)	That's sucks.  Where has she been?"
"I'm planning on moving to a new city, but I'm starting to get cold feet.	What city are you going in too?"
"I'm just unsure about the city...like what if I'm miserable there?	If the cost is just right maybe you can find something that you really love.  But if it's in a different city than you've already made the connection I see no reason to be nervous.  Just do it!"
"One of the things I had to do when I started my job was be in charge of moving a department.  When we were doing it, one of my coworkers bailed on me.	Wow! That was rude of them, did you give them any money for it?"
"There were others, but we needed all the help we could get.	Thats unfortunate. Did they help you move the department or just the department as a whole?"
"Everybody say a quiet place movie was boring but i still decided to watch it and i was pretty impressed! That movie was so amazing, I feel like i was holding my breath the whole time	What movie was it?"
"omg, you should! It's a one of a kind movie. I don't wanna spoil it, it's about aliens	What movie was it?"
"it sure must be nice to be able to get all the cool stuff, and do whatever you want and not have to work for any of it.	It really is,  is there anything like that where you live?"
"Yeah me either. I have some friends that get to experience it. Fortunately they are sharing so that is nice.	It sure is nice. Do you work for any of them?"
"I was disgusted when I noticed the food on the table	Eww!  I guess some people aren't satisfied with just bread and butter?  Did you flip the table over?"
"It was brussel sprouts and Liver	Ew that's pretty gross! Why did you notice that?!"
"I have a lab mix and he is so well behaved and listens to commands so well. I'm glad I got him as a puppy.	I bet that makes you happy! I rescue animals aswell and they are the most rewarding as dogs!"
"oh yea. Basically started the day we got him. That definitely helped.	I bet he's a smart little pup!"
"Yes. I couldnt' handle a dog I have to keep shut up when people come over and stuff.	Oh no! What happened?"
"My friend just recently moved to California...It makes me sad because I have always wanted to live there.	I am sorry to hear that... does she have a new place already?"
"Yeah...I really am. I've wanted to live there since I was a little girl. Someday I will!	You should go and start a business, make enough money so you don't live in the ghetto!"
"When I was planning my wedding, the caterer we were trying to go with kept blowing us off and dodging communication.	That is annoying when someone does something they shouldn't be doing. Did you end up canceling the wedding?"
"Yeah, we dropped them with enough time to find someone else, but it was unnecessary stress we didn't need.	Oh that sounds so frustrating! I am glad you weren't let down by their response though."
"It is so frustrating having to deal with difficult customers that don't want to pay their bills/	yes frustrating! It makes me want to leave all day long and never talk to you guys ever again."
"Normally I would agree. It only seems to be a few here and there. Most of the time I dont have problems.	I am with you on that. I work at a fast food joint and they always have difficult workers. I always find it frustrating as well because you have to do a lot of paperwork to work with them and it takes forever!"
"We are a retail outfit. So we have some big customers that pay on established terms.	I'm going overseas in 2 weeks! I will be on vacaion for 1 months and I just CAN NOT wait@	Where to? I have never left the US"
"Where did you go?	Where did you go?"
"I just about had a figurative heart attack the other night.	Oh no!  What happened?!  What was it that happened to?"
"I woke up in the wee hours and thought I saw a person standing in the corner of my room.  It was just some clothes hanging on a door.	Oh my gosh! What did it look like?"
"I'm very annoyed because my friend didn't give me my money back	That's not very friend like."
"Yes! it was to cover his rent and he was supposed to pay me back	Wow...thats not right!"
"I typically procrastinate when needing to pack for a trip. But this time I got my butt in gear and it's all done several days early.	That's cool. I usually procrastinate as well but I'm working right now so I can relate haha."
"Thanks. I usually get somewhere and realize I forgot a bunch of stuff I need cause I packed in a rush 30 minutes before leaving.	That's really lucky. I always tend to go through the same problem as you, but I think you've got it all planned out. I'm proud of you!"
"Fortunately, my wife usually comes to the rescue on me.	It happens to the best of us. I have not had one forget anything in the last 5 years"
"My wife was working yesterday, but she ended up taking the rest of the day off to spend time with me! I was shocked.	That's nice. Did you spend time reading or watching anything cool?"
"We did! We went out for lunch and hung out on the beach. It was very relaxing and a nice change.	That's awesome! It's nice to have time for our relationship to shine, and to not have it be a chore to get it together!"
"I went to a restaurant my wife really likes with some friends while she was at work.  It's not a big thing, but I felt a little bad about it :P	Why is it not a big deal?"
"Not like really bad, just kind of bad that I went somewhere my wife likes when she couldn't go.  It's not a big deal, but I feel bad when I do things like that.	Yeah, i understand"
"That horror movie made me terrified	What was it? I've avoided it at all cost!"
"Scream	I saw that movie too!  What was it about???  Did it scare you!!  I can't even watch it now after rewatching it."
"I really want to have another baby. Baby fever is real lol I don't want to be all crazy about it, don't wanna track ovulation and do all this but i really wanna get pregnant asap	I hear you! Have you ever tried a chirurgical pregnancy? My daughter is chirurgical and she had two pretty successful ones!"
"thank you :) oh yeah, you can track ovulation, measure basal body temperature, etc. I'm not gonna go into details	Oh wow! I didn't know you could do that! That's pretty interesting. How many kids do you want to have?"
"My mom bought be a book online.  It should be here today I'm just waiting on the delivery man.	What book are you waiting for"
"Yes it is.  She wanted two options so I wouldn't know which she'd pick.  She picked the right one so now it's just a waiting game.	Wow! What an awesome mom. What kind of book is it?"
"It is nice to have in-laws that are accepting and loving. So many people don't have a good relationship with their in-laws.	I agree. My husband and my mother in-laws have a strained relationship. My mother in law refuses to take my husband to the doctor's for check-up and my husband refused to get his checked up."
"Aw I'm sorry. Mine is only a few years old but it's been smooth sailing so far.	That is great to hear.  My in-laws are only a few miles apart, but they have both moved away."
"I have been trying to get my oldest son to be more responsible.  I started out small by asking him to adopt a good sleep schedule.  After several weeks he still hasn't.	You need to look at the big picture of life. He is not the father because he does not have the emotional attachment to the mom that you do. He is the product and the father because his work and life force is what defines the mom."
"He does well enough in school.  I think that might make him think he doesn't need any disciple in everyday life.  Make me worry a bit.	Maybe he's just a little homesick. Give it a few more weeks."
"My wife usually sniffs out anything going on, but I was able to successfully plan a surprise party for her without her knowing.	That is good! Surprise parties are the best!"
"Yes. Friends, family, cake, all of it. Even one friend from out of town she hasnt seen in years.	You must really be anticipating something good."
"Thank you. Probably wont be able to do it again, but happy it worked this time.	I am so grateful for my wife	That is nice to hear! What makes you grateful?"
"She really is! I couldn't be where I am without her	Sounds like you have a great wife!"
"I can handle, bees, scorpions, wasps, crickets, and spiders.  But for some reason I lose my mind around roaches.	Really? Because that seems pretty reasonable."
"I take some conselation in that, however my kids laugh when they hear thier dad scream like a girl at a flying roach.	Yeah I understand how that goes"
"I feel guilty because I couldn't go to my friends party	Why not? What was going on that night?"
"I was working and I couldn't leave early	Why couldn't you go? That sounds like a bummer!"
"As a momma's boy I always missed my mom anytime she was gone for an extended period of time.	I can imagine.  I had a mommy issues when my daughter was young, I think it's normal for that."
"Fortunately, she rarely was gone for long periods of time, but I always dreaded this once a year work training she had to do.	I bet that is a relief to not worry about her missing!"
"Oh it's great.	I am so excited about going to the movies	What movie are you going to see?"
"I'm going to see the purge. I have been waiting to see it for a while	I've never heard of it! What is that? A Halloween movie?"
"I saw a homeless lady and i felt so bad for her because it was so hot outside so went to five guys and bought her some food and cold drinks	That's very sweet of you.  It's amazing how much some of the world's poorest people can help each other out by providing a warm body of water.  She is lucky to have you guys checking her out."
"blessing bags?? what are those?	They are called life savers. They are great for people in desperate times."
"wow that's a great idea! I will do the same! thanks for sharing	The other day I framed the puzzle we used as a guest book at our wedding.	What was the puzzle of?"
"Etsy somewhere.  My wife bought it, so I don't really know which one, but you can find a bunch on there.	That's cool.  I've been looking for a new quilt for my quilt.  Is it one you got for free?"
"Well, what a trip that was. I just drove from Northern California to Florida. I just knew there would be no problems, and I was right.	That sounds like a very interesting drive! How did it go?"
"Six days in all, but I wasn't rushing it. I wanted to see a bit of the country. It was amazing actually.	Was it beautiful? I always love driving through beautiful National Park places."
"It's not so bad really. You get used to it. If you remember to stop and stretch now and again you're ok. And there are some decent rest areas, some with free coffee!	I'm glad you enjoyed your trip so much!"
"Oh yes. Anything to keep the eyes open and on the road!	I'm so happy for you! I need to stop driving so much."
"I have big renovation plans for my house.  I've made a money plan and have kept to it so far.	Well done! What are your specific plans as far as making money and doing the things that you've been doing?"
"Yes, hopefully it will all go as planned.  So far so good.	Well that sounds really great! I hope everything works out for you!"
"I was so anxious for my kid to graduate	Did he graduate?"
"It did. I'm very proud of him	Congratulations! That is awesome. You sound like a really big dad. How old is he?"
"I didn't really try to use weight but i started going to the pool and i actually lost a couple of lbs	That's great.  How much did you lose"
"it's really fun and it's also a great exercise! Plus water is so relaxing	I used to be afraid to go to the pool as a kid."
"I hope when I get older, Im not lonely as I am now	i agree on one hand but disagree on the other hahahaha. what made you feel that way?"
"I was engaged but my woman left me	I'm sorry to hear that, but I think it's important to remember the reasons behind your relationship. You can't get everything all or everything."
"I recently heard In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins.	Really, that song is so relaxing, I love it!"
"Yeah, for some reason it takes me back to being a kid in the 80's.  No specific memory just a general feeling.	That's an odd nostalgia trip for sure"
"I got upset at my oldest son's lack of motivation.  I feel bad that I got angry with him though.	Oh no. Did he do something bad?"
"True.  I just haven't found a way to yet.  Need to be more creative.	Creativity is key. How long has he been a kid?"
"K and I went to see a house a while ago. I don't know what happened there, but when I went upstairs I became more and more nervous and eventually ran back downstairs and out the door. Scary or what.	Haha, that must have scared you but I'm glad it worked out in the end"
"It was as if something was telling me to get out. K had the same feeling in the basement. I've never had that happen before.	I think scary situations are totally possible in your basement! I'm sorry you had that happen to you!"
"Could be. It used to be a home for disabled people. We were both terrified, but we didn't say anything until we were back in our car.	I love streaming services but sometimes they really frustrate me.	what is frustrate"
"Every once in awhile I get the idea to search for a movie, and almost every time it's either not listed or requires an extra charge.	Yeah I understand what you mean. It really throws me off when they don't work for me"
"My eldest niece, who helps take care of her younger disabled sister, graduated high school with great grades recently. She works hard both at her studies and taking care of her sister - she deserves it.	That's great that she has such a caring family."
"Yes, I got her tickets for a show in London that she's been wanting to see. She lives in Scotland, so the journey isn't bad at all. She's taking a friend with her.	That must be a relief to not have to carry any extra luggage.  It's nice that you guys can enjoy your time together.  What's the show?"
"I do hope she has a wonderful time. It's not easy living in a family with a disabled sibling and she just takes it all in her stride.	I want to ask this girl I'm friends with out but I'm nervous to to so.	Why's that"
"Problem is if she says no then it would make things weird between us.  I am afraid that either way I may not be able to see her again.	Just be confident that she will be nice if she changes her mind!  It's not too late!"
"I really wanted to try bison meet and I went all the way to that whole foods store like 57 miles away and they didn't have it, what a waste of time	that sounds disappointing! where was the nearest store?"
"thank you! I hope i can find it somewhere locally. i've heard bison meat is very lean and good	Oh that sounds disappointing. I do not think it is healthy for you to go that far away from home."
"My rottweiler passes a lot of gas in the evenings.	I bet that makes you anxious, mine don't at all"
"Not so much.  It is such a thick scent and it follows you everywhere you go in the house.  I usually put him out when he starts it up.	Oh, that is terrible! Do you have any control over how much gas he can hold?"
"It's been a long week! My husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler.	Well at least the baby is learning to sleep. That's one less baby trying to get into mommy diapers."
"I sure hope so! He's in the military so I never know when he'll get called on a mission :(	That must be frustrating.  How long will he be away?"
"I once walkd around the grocery store without knowing my fly was down.	Did anyone see you do it or did you figure it out on your own?"
"I found an empty aile a went to zip up.  Just then a mom with kids comes around the corner.	Haha.. that's funny. I once forgot my fly was down as well...Mom, get off my lawn!"
"It's been a hard day today, its so quiet in my house. I hate when my husband is out of town.	I totally understand.  How are you coping today?"
"In a few months, he is in the military so he is gone a lot :( But I know he is doing it for our family and our country!	Aww, that is so sweet of him. I am sure he is having a wonderful time in his military apartment."
"My young niece, who is disabled, was recently rushed to hospital. She's ok now but we were very worried for a while there.	That's good.  I'm glad to hear that she's doing better!"
"Chest infection which, for her, can prove fatal. She had to go on a special oxygen machine till the antibiotics kicked in.	I am so sorry to hear that.  She is lucky to be alive."
"It was touch and go for a few days. My brother and family are such great carers. Wish I could be too, but they live in Scotland.	I have this cat that loves to cause issues	That's unfortunate.  Cats can be so annoying"
"Like last night. She decided that she wanted to jump on the table	Lol that's funny.  Poor kitty, I bet she didn't last very much"
"I have tried to complete a work assigment three times now without sucuess.	I'm sorry, that sounds really frustrating.  Do you have someone help you?"
"Doubtful.  I will try again and then try a coworker if not sucuessfull.	Why do you doubt yourself? Are you sure you want to continue?"
"I couldn't go to movies to watch The greatest showman when it came out so my husband bought this movie when it came out. he is sweet	What movie is it?"
"it's called The Greatest Showman. it's a musical! So good!! I watched it so many times already	Oh wow! That sounds like a really good musical. What was the name?"
"A few weeks ago a coworker called in sick. I had to work twice as long as I normally would.	That's crazy! Why did they call in sick?"
"It was, but it didn't help my feelings towards that coworker.	I bet that was a difficult thing for you. Did it make you feel bad?"
"That is true, I just hope he was really sick. I hate it when I have to cover for people who are hungover.	My wife has been out of the country for school for 2 months.  I misread the calendar and thought she was getting back a week earlier than she is.	Oh no! I hope she is OK!"
"Yeah.  It could be worse, but it definitely put a cloud over things for half an hour or so.	Oh that's awful! I'm so sorry you're having to deal with that.  I hope she gets to see you soon!"
"It's been awhile since I lost my last job.  After two years of working my family and I are finally moving into a home of our own.	It's been a long move for me too! Did you buy a house?"
"After such a long time we certainly will.  I can't wait to start making the house into our home.	That's fantastic! What made you decide to move?"
"Our pet cat will need to be put down soon.	I'm so sorry to hear that!"
"Yes we've had her since the begining.  She is older now and has suffered with feline AIDS for awhile.	That's terrible, my girlfriend's cat used to be like that too. I don't know how our pet can live through something so horrific like that."
"It really makes me angry to see that many homeless people on the street	I know. I see so many people crying and needing help in the street. Makes me feel pity on them."
"I personally dont have time to volunteer but every friday i always make a small donation to my local charity	That is so nice of you."
"My husband shocked me the other day	What happened?"
"He threw me a surprise party and jumped out at me scaring me half to death!	What a jerk! What did you do?"
"I don't get why anyone would cheat on their other half.	I guess they weren't thinking about how they would hurt her, I guess."
"No thankfully  I havent. I would never do it. Have you?	Yes I have and its hard but they dont realize it till theres a problem. I was tempted to marry my now fiance but I am no eunuch and am too shy to do it."
"I was planning to view the stars last night, but it was storming. It was supposed to be the brightest that Jupiter will be in a while.	Jupiter is a great planet! I love the red giant though!"
"It does! I am hoping that tonight will be clear.	Jupiter is a great place to look"
"A new baby means a lot changes.  One of those is the amount of time my wife and I have together.	Congratulation"
"Agreed.  I know it's a necessary thing but I'm a little jealous of the time my wife spends with the baby.	A new baby also means more responsibility and stress.  It's a good thing that your wife has decided to take the time away from raising the newborn to help the mother."
"My mom is so great! She is always there for me and her grandchildren. I can't think of anyone that loves us as much as she does!	That is really sweet. Moms are the best"
"I'm sure that's hard at times. I've always lived close to my mom so I can't really imagine being too far away.	I'm so happy for you! It's so nice when you have great family members you can completely rely on."
"I am dreading the two hour trip to the grocery store this week.	where you garther than usual?"
"Me too!! Being so far out, it takes forever to get anywhere. I miss civilization lol.	Where do you live that it takes so long to get to the store?"
"We are workcamping in the mountains of NM. It takes about an hour and a half to two hours to get anywhere lol. We havent seen new faces around here in months lol.	im really exited to go to disneyland on vacation next summer	That is really exciting! I wish I could go on vacation too! What are you most excited for?"
"yes im staying at the hotel for the first time i am really happy	That's exciting! I've never stayed at a Disney property! Have fun!"
"I finished a class and most of my classmates got an A! It took a lot of work.	I bet you worked hard for that class!"
"It sure does! I am so proud of the hard work that everyone put in!	that's great. what are you planning on doing with your degree?"
"I have the best kids in the world.	Really? What makes you so sure of it."
"Lots of little stuff.  They love to draw me pictures, crack jokes, and give lots of kisses.	Those are nice gifts to have as kids!"
"My husband has been putting in so many extra hours at work	What does he do at work?"
"Oh I am pampering the heck out of him! It got him a promotion!	Well that's nice. I hope he deserves it."
"I just got laid off from my job. I need the paycheck so this is not a good situation.	Dang! What kind of payday do you have coming up?"
"I am going to apply for new positions. Hopefully I will get something soon.	I hope you do too. It is a tough position to fill, but I believe in you"
"I work in I.T.! Thanks for asking!	I just applied for a new job! It is a job that I have always wanted.	Congratulations! What kind of job is it for?"
"Thank you! Have you ever applied to your dream job?	I have applied but I always get turned down. What is your industry?"
"i ahte when my Girlfriend goes to the club alone	oh really"
"Yeah it makes me really jelous when guys talk to her	That's cool man. Where do you guys go to meet her?"
"When I worked as a hotel rep. in Spain a few years ago I was greeting guests one morning. Suddenly I saw someone I knew - it was my cousin who decided to come and visit me. It was so unexpected!	How'd it go after that?"
"It really was. I had no idea he was coming to visit. I couldn't believe my eyes!	Did he treat you well?"
"We certainly did. Where I was working was a seaside resort and there are loads of clubs, restaurants etc. so we'd go to the beach and then party at night. Brilliant fun!	My Keurig just died. This is the third coffee pot in less than a year!	Oh no! That is heartbreaking! How old is your Keurig?"
"I agree! I am so disgusted right now!!! We drink a lot of coffee lol. Its a 2 hour drive to the closest town to get another one too.	I feel your pain. I moved into a 1.5 million dollar mansion just so I could have one. Now I don't drive and have to buy another one every few years!"
"We travel fill-time in our RV so I don't really have room to carry a back up. I hope our next location is more accessible to civilization.	I just had to move across country to a new job.	Oh wow! Why did that make you move?"
"I am actually! I was so ready for it. I basically studied moving so that everything would be easy	That's good, where did you move?"
"One day my daughter got off the bus and was crying. An older boy intentionally tripped her as she got off the bus and she got hurt. This made me very upset and mad!	wow thats so mean"
"He just thought it would be funny! He was also several years older than her and a teenager. Too old to know better!	That is so sad!"
"We recently found out that our 15 year old son has a rare, degenerative neurological disease.	Wow, so sorry! I have the same disease and it is really, really sad!"
"No, the doctors tell us there is no cure. They are trying to treat the symptoms but thus far its been unsuccessful.	Wow, poor kid. I hope he gets some help soon, that must be tough."
"Thank you, its been scary. He has good days and bad.	The door bell rang last month. I wasn't expecting anyone, but it was my daughter and her family from way up north.	Were they upset about something?"
"I couldn't believe it. It had been almost a year since I saw them and she never even gave me a hint they were coming.	That would have scared me.  Were they trying to sell something or perhaps visiting?"
"I've studied hard all night in order to make myself ready for tomorrow's test	That's a good thing, how do you think it's going to go?"
"Repititions and exposure are my strategies.  Sumer semesters really ramp things up.	It sounds like you're ready to go, good luck! What is your test on?"
"Going through an unused drawer I found old drawing from when my kids were little	Wow thats always fun. Did it make you happy?"
"While the actual incidents of each drawing are lost in time it did make me think back to when they were younger.	That is wonderful that you have memories like that.  It's nice to be reminded of good times with them!"
"I just had my husband remind me of when I fainted when he proposed!	Oh no! How was that?"
"I was so happy when I saw him get down on one knee that I just blacked out lmao	lol thats amazing... proposal flash back or what"
"The news announced a tornado warning. I ignored it at first, but then the city tornado siren went off.	How scary!  I'm glad your ok!"
"I almost panicked as the winds started to gust, but thankfully it missed us. A few miles up the road weren't so lucky though. Always listen to those warnings	That sounds awful!  Did you get hurt or property damaged?"
"I got a new puppy for my birthday! She is a cutie!	I bet she's going to be lots of puppy talkative!"
"I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.	that is so sweet!! i bet she is the cutest pup on the block"
"I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.	That's an interesting way to remember the name!"
"My neighbor ran into my car! They didn't even leave a note!	That's terrible! Did you call the police?"
"I could tell by the color of the paint left on my car, and their car now has a scrape with the color of my car. I don't know what to do.	That is so awful! Did you file a complaint?"
"A thunderstorm raged all of last night! It kept me awake all night!	Wow I could have sworn I had heard one of those tonight....do tell"
"It is quite frightening! I wish that I could overcome my fear.	That is terrifying, I cannot even imagine!"
"I just applied for graduate school! I feel good about my chances!	That's awesome! I hope you do well"
"Thank you! I am very excited! It is quite unsettling though.	That's great! I hope you do well on your interviews! Are you nervous?"
"I remember just taking a deep breath the other day in the garden and just feeling happy	That's good, deep breaths breathe is the key to life!"
"I have a garden so fully packed that I can't see my neighbors at all!	Wow that sounds like a wonderful feeling! You must feel secure and at peace! What is your garden like?"
"My neighbor really helped me out recently after a big windstorm.	That was nice of them. Was it a big blow?"
"No, they generously helped me clean up my yard and cut up a tree with their chainsaw, and they asked for nothing in return.	Oh wow, that's nice of them. I wish more people would help each other."
"My son just graduated from high school! He has worked so hard, and he even earned a scholarship.	that's awesome. what school did you guys go to? congrats btw. i went to tamiami."
"Thank you! He is going to study Computer Science!	Wow, good for him! He must have been so excited."
"I am taking a trip to Disney World next month! My wife is going for the first time!	That's awesome! I've never been to Disneyland!"
"I have been a couple of times before, and it is such a magical place! Where are you planning on taking a trip to?	I have never taken a vacation to Disney World.  I am taking my 5 year nephew to Florida!"
"I slipped and fell in the restroom last week. The floors desperately needed cleaned.	Oh no! Are you ok?"
"The only thing to get injured was my pride. It was quite the gross experience.	Oh no! I hope you were okay and not injured too bad."
"The other day Comcast customer service kept me waiting for 20 minutes just to speak with someone. What a disgrace!	Talk about unacceptable customer service! What did they do?"
"They're awful. If they'd just employ enough cs people to handle the volume you could just about bear it!	I feel your pain! At least they tried to listen"
"Mind you, their product is useless too. Ok, rant over!	Queue jumping is something which irks me no end. I was at the deli counter of my local store recently and some guy came up and started ordering. The employee served him, too.	That's annoying"
"Yes. And I'm disabled and it's hard to stand for a long time while some idiot gets his lunch. I hope it was horrible!	That's really not fair. I mean they should not be able to treat disabled people any differently just because they're different."
"Perhaps salmonella poisoning? One can only hope, lol!	I am very glad we headed the warnings and evacuated prior to Hurricane Harvey.	I bet. Was it a bad hurricane?"
"Yes it was a scary time. We stocked up on food and bottled water and moved our RV about an hour and a half inland. Luckily the storn went to the north of us.	What caused the warning? I haven't heard anything like that since I was a little kid"
"Our Rv is our home, we are full-time Rvers! Thank you so much! Have you ever been through an evactuation? Did you feel prepared?	This past Mother's Day my husband gave me some wonderful unexpected gifts! He even got me a gorgeous diamond ring.	That is so sweet and fortunate that he trusted you!"
"I was! It was so thoughtful and sweet, and I was very touched by it.	That sounds really sweet. What is the diamond ore for, again? I've never heard of such a thing!"
"My parents are going to a tea room for their anniversary.	That's nice of them! Do they enjoy tea parties?"
"No that is where they decided to go but the thing is I called the place and they can't accommodate my special diet I am on.  I am so sad b/c that means I can't go with the.	That's a shame. Maybe they can make it accommodating for you."
"I am very excited for the arrival of our 7th grandbaby!	I am excited for you!"
"Thank you, I try to be the best Nana I can be. We are hoping she comes while we are visiting for Christmas!	That's so sweet! I am a mom, so I completely understand! What an exciting time of the year!"
"Thank you so much! I surely will.	My dad has early onset dementia	I'm sorry, I've been through it. It can be very scary."
"Yes, I try my hardest to be caring and patient with him b/c I know he doesn't mean to be harsh or hard to deal with at times.	I'm so sorry to hear that.  I recently went through some of the same stuff with mine."
"At work today, all my coworkers sang me happy birthday. It was so nice of them!	Oh wow! That is very thoughtful of them. Happy Birthday to You!"
"It was so thoughtful of them. I didn't even mention it was my birthday.	Wow! I bet you were so thankful for that! It's always nice to get unexpected gifts on special occassions like that!"
"I don't know. But they sure wen't above and beyond!	I took a huge test today and man it made me so nervous. I really hope I did well on it.	Did it make you nervous? or were you more prepared than you had been before? I'm sure if you practiced, it'll become a muscle memory that you'll get used to."
"I did, I studied every day for week! I almost wore myself out studying.	That's awesome! Studying really pays off!"
"I really hope so, I am so nervous while I wait for my results.	I am so proud of my son	What did he do to make you proud!"
"He got the highest score on a test	that's so cool, good for him!"
"My husband usually gets a big bonus around this time of the year. We are eagerly waiting, hoping, and waiting for it!	What does he usually get?"
"It is! It's not a guarantee though, so it's just a waiting game, and not easy.	What game is this?"
"I am so angry that my brother didnt come to my party	Oh no, why was he not able?"
"I am not sure. I just don't know why he didn't show	Well, did he give you a reason? Maybe he is a shy guy."
"I am confident that I will have a great day tomorrow	Why do you feel confident about tomorrow?"
"That is so true. Getting to know you also makes it seem like a great day already leading to tomorrow.	I like days like that! They give off an amazing feeling"
"I have trusting issues because my fiance left  me	Oh no. How come?"
"I know but it's so hard because no one wants to be with me	I am sorry to hear about that.  Have you tried to have a talk?"
"Flying typically doesn't bother me too much, because I love travel. However I was a bit concerned on a flight once right after a travel advisory had been issued.	Traveling is never easy.  I flew for the first time and was terrified!  How did it turn out?"
"Well i did have a few of those. It went fine. I was still nervous even after we landed in a foreign country. I just watched my surroundings. Everything went great.	That sounds like it would be a little scary. Where did you land in?"
"I am so lonely right now because no one wants to be with me	I'm so sorry. That is so sad... I hope things will work themselves out."
"Yeah, but no luck	I know the feeling. Do you have a significant other?"
"when i was younger I was really getting into graphic design and really wanted a new Apple computer. I knew my parents couldnt afford it, but they somehow made it happen and surprised me on Christmas..	wow, that sounds really awesome!  What kind of graphic did your computer get?  I'm guessing they found one that looked decent and then made it into one that you could actually play on!  What was your most memorable moment was making that computer?"
"yea my parents are pretty great. Pretty maddening at times, but I wouldn't trade them.	Well its good that they were able to get you into the computer side of things."
"I hope to be there one day and see it from that side.	i felt really good when i won a poker tournament last week	That's cool!  How much money did you win?"
"yes it was, it took a long time to do but at the end it was worth it	That's cool! What level of play was it?"
"Spiders is one of my gratest fear they make me so scared	I'm the same! I'm never too far from a spider. Do they bother you in the real world?"
"i have tried to overcome my fear but i just cant they make my skin temble	I hate them too! They are so big and slithery!"
"i am impressed that video games grow so much every year	yes they sure do. I used to love playing them on my Nintendo 64"
"that is a great game the growth on video games has been amazing this past few years	I agree, what is your favorite video game to play now?"
"We went out to dinner for our first anniversary and they got our order all wrong.	that's annoying. did they fix the orders after you complained?"
"Thank you. The restaurant came highly rated by a lot of people so I guess my expectations were high. I tried not to let it bother me.	That's frustrating. I bet if you corrected it they'd forgive you eventually."
"My wife flew home to see family. It is very quite at home now.	How many people do you have?"
"I know, that would of been nice! Instead I was all alone for the last few weeks.	That sucks"
"Me too, a home doesn't feel like a home without a woman.	i am really impressed everytime i see my nephew on how fast he is growing	How fast is he?  Is that even a real thing??"
"yeah but i dont see him very often maybe that is why i always get shocked when i see him	That's cool that your son is growing so quickly. Does he run well, too?"
"When I got the phone call that my mom had cancer I was so upset.	Oh my god. I'm so sorry to hear that. Cancer is such a horrible disease!"
"It's hard watching one of your parents get sick. We were at the movie theater when I found out and I had to leave.	that is so sad, I hope she pulls thru"
"one of the best days of my life was when i graduated from high school	I can only imagine, graduation is a very big event."
"i know right time goes really fast and you dont even noticed, for me it was 13 years ago	Oh that must've felt amazing to accomplish. Congratulations!"
"The other night I was driving home in the rain and slid into the guard rail. It is going to cost so much to get my car fixed!	Was the other driver okay"
"I know, I will have to be more careful next time. I shouldn't eat ice-cream while driving,	That's too bad. Are your cars in good shape though?"
"It will still move, but I can't steer very well with the front tires missing.	There is a tornado coming. But I have the pantry full and am ready this time.	Tornadoes can be pretty scary, have you been in one before?"
"You never know how long the power might be out for!	Oh wow, I would have thought you'd want to stock up before that!"
"It could take a while for any sort of rescue to come!	I had a pretty large loan, with a bit of a high interest rate, and a high monthly payment. My mother decided to pay it off for me, out of the blue!	Wow! What an awesome surprise! How much did she give you for it?"
"Yes, I couldn't believe it. She's so sweet and giving, but I sure didn't expect her to do that!	That was so wonderful of her! She sounds like an amazing person."
"My husband is the most faithful man I know	That's great! How long have you been married?"
"I have so many health problems and he is always there for many no matter what being loving and caring	That is an amazing story. How old are you?"
"I left the front door unlocked and the mailman robbed me. I couldn't believe I would do that.	That is so awful!  I hope it didn't actually do anything bad to you!"
"Only my pride! I wasn't at home when he robbed me. He took a lot of valuables.	oh god..that had to be so awful! I am so sorry! How awful to be robbed at a time like that! I am glad you returned the things you stole"
"I hope so! A federal worker like that should have more integrity!	I have always been afraid of snakes i dont know what to do to control my fear for them	I'm with you on that one! Have you gone to the pet store to try and buy some snakes?"
"yes, i one time i was taking a hike and 3 meters to my left was a rattle snake i jumped like a rabbit and ran back to my friends	That's terrifying! I'm glad to hear you made friends with a friend who was brave enough to help you out."
"I was annoyed when my wife left me	Why did she leave?"
"Yeah its been a rough 2 weeks for me	That's too bad. Are things going better for you now that she left?"
"I was afraid when I went into the movies alone	How was it? Out of group or with a group?"
"Because I have always been with someone, so going in alone just frightened me	Yeah I can understand. It's scary to go alone for sure!"
"I've been married almost 23 years. My husband travel so much, but we both have trust in each other to be true and loyal.	That is so wonderful!  23 years is a long lasting marriage - so wonderful!  Are you having any children?"
"for his job. So, it can be hard, but we trust each other.	It is very hard to find true love.  But, you are married it seems."
"I am hopeful that my friend will be able to make it to my party	how come?"
"It is to me because he is my best friend	What party do you have planned?"
"I have been exercising and taking care of myself more lately.	That is great! What do you have been doing?"
"I think many do, but man does it feel good.	how much longer do you have to keep going?"
"I am joyful that I am with my wife	That is great. How long have you been with her?"
"We have been together for 10 years	That's a long time. How did you guys get to that stage in life?"
"I felt pretty luck the other day! I won $100 on a scratch off ticket! I never win!	Holy cow, that's awesome! I never win either! I need to start playing the lottery!"
"Not usually, I never win. so, it was very unexpected.	Wow! That is a fantastic feat! I never win either! But I still love winning! How did you do it?"
"My sister was given $1,000 by my grandma as a graduation present. She did not give me a penny.	That's really nice of her!"
"Perhaps, I just don't understand why I was left out. Seems unfair.	I think its just a way for her to show that she is the one who raised you.  Maybe you just don't understand?"
"We went on our vacation about a week ago to the beach and it rained several days while we were there. We wanted to go to the beach every day!	That's too bad. Maybe you could plan to do it the next summer, when the weather starts to change."
"Yes, and when you pay a fortune to get beachfront! But, we still had a good time, just wished we could have had less rain!	I would have loved the rain too! I live near the beach and it's always so beautiful there during the summer. You're very lucky!"
"I was given the opportunity to work at a new job that I was hoping to get! I never thought it would be possible!	Oh that's cool! What was the position?"
"Thank you! I feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity.	Congratulations on getting this opportunity! What kind of job was it?"
"I fell down in a mud puddle today while walking to lunch. I was covered in mud for the rest of the work day.	Oh no!  Was it a nice mud puddle or a bad one?"
"No kidding! It was hard to keep a good attitude for the rest of the day.	Oh no!  That's terrible!!  I've been there done that before!  Did you get soaked?"
"My husband works nights a lot right now.	are you happy with that? i mean it sounds kind of boring"
"It really is, i hate being alone at night.	Do you enjoy single nights?"
"A few, but he still has to sleep all day, makes doing things hard.	I'm anxious (if excited!) about an upcoming move -- we've lived overseas before, but this is such a different state and climate, I'm not sure what to expect!	Wow, that sounds exciting! How far are you guys from each other?"
"Alaska! We've got some transition time, but I've been doing deep research on Anchorage -- and the more I see, the more I like!	Wow, an overseas move sounds like so much fun! But I'm sure the weather will be bad!"
"I hate that people hit on others they know are married.	oh me too...that's a horrible thing to happen"
"Right? Happens to my husband all the time and it's just frustrating.	I agree, I don't understand why some people get so worked up about other people getting married! How do they treat other people?"
"No, since it's his associates at work!!	i cannot wait for the next star wars movie to come out	When does it come out?"
"he is, i really like the new ones but always will like the old ones better	Heck yeah, that's my favorite cartoon! Who is your favorite character?"
"i hate when i fart in public it is so embarrasing	My mom has told me about this. I hate it when people do it in public."
"i can hold them but some of them are just accidental and it is the worst, depends on what i eat haha	I am the same, i can barely contain the force when i fart."
"My husband recently got me a great gift. He got me a beautiful 14 kt diamond ring! I had no idea he was.	Oh wow! He must have a super heart."
"Yes, it was so sweet and unexpected. We've been married almost 23 years so I guess I deserve it lol	That is very sweet. I am very sure you deserve this ring!!"
"i hate that people dont care and they just throw their trash on the street	I agree. I see people throw their beer cans all the time in the city.  It's terrible!  Does your city have any dedicated enforcement team?"
"if im walking i pick up as much as i can	That is the worst, when you are trying to help someone but they just throw it all around you!"
"i am extremely afraid of going near hiights	I am as well. What makes you feel afraid?"
"Yeah last year i went to disneyland and got on the elevator game and i almost cried hahaha	That sounds super exciting!  I bet that was exciting for both you and the person being rescued!"
"The last job interview I went on also went well, but it took a long time to hear back from them.	I'm sure the interview was long and the wait was no big deal! Did they call you back for another interview?"
"Oh, I did eventually, it just took like a month.  I ended up getting the job!	That's awesome. It takes a while to build that anticipation in the interview. I'm glad you did it."
"i cant wait for my disneyland vacation next summer	i really want to go to disneyland, what is your favorite place in the area?"
"i think me and my family is going there for 1 week it is going to be wonderfull	That sounds amazing! I haven't been to Disneyland in over 15 years! My favorite coaster is still in operation! Do you like it?"
"i am getting my new car next week and cant wait for it.	That's awesome! what kind of car is it?"
"it is a 2017 bmw, i traded in my old car to get an awesome deal	Nice! what kind of car did you get?"
"My in-laws are helping us pay for school clothes for our kids this year.	That's nice of them, how much are they paying?"
"Yeah, it helps take some of the burden off of us. I will have to check out Goodwill and see if I can find anything.	That's very kind of them!"
"Wow, those prices are great. I'll be going by there for sure. Yeah, the best part about them helping, is that they do it, not expecting anything in return. They just all of us and want to help.	That's a good thing. Most of us don't take anything for free, it drives me crazy."
"Yes, they are great.	I was in a college class once with an older woman.  She took a paper idea I had talked about and presented it as her own, stealing all the work I had done.	Wow. Did you get in trouble?"
"I did.  There wasn't much she could do, but at least I could still do the same paper without having to redo a bunch of work.	That must have been aggravating! Did she get a beat down?"
"i really hate when people make me wait for no reason	What do you think you are going to do when you are waiting?"
"my girlfriend allways makes me wait, it makes me really anxious ahhahah	Oh geez! Me too - but I think it's just because they've never had to actually wait for something to actually happen than just hop on a bus or something. Makes me feel like a slob! But then again, I'm an introvert and an out of towner so... I never thought much"
"One of my best friends is moving far away and i dont know when i will be able to see him again	Aww, that stinks! Hopefully soon though because that's where he was before and it's where you were when you last spoke?"
"yeah i can call him and email him, it is just that i dont know when we will see eachother again	I'm so sorry you're going through this. Have you asked him about it?"
"I think having goals is important. My mother in law has managed to lose weight and walked daily.	That's awesome! It's goal achieved and accomplished in one convenient step!"
"Very similar ones, but I like focusing on others success	I do agree with you there, I try not to be envious!"
"It really does, hope any you have works out!	i hate to see people mistreating animals i cant stand it	I feel the same way! Why can't people be nice to animals!"
"i know right, it is really sad some people cant understand they suffer as well as you and me	I'm glad that you have a voice and can voice your opinions! I don't understand why people can't take a hint not to be cruel to others..."
"the day i gratuaded from college is my favorite day	What college?"
"the fact that it took so much work and time	That's awesome that you have that special day. What college did you attend?"
"i cant wait for my new tv that i ordered online and will recive this weekend	What tv did you get?"
"yeah it is twice the size as the tv that i have at the moment	That's awesome! What provider do you have it on?"
"I have an older friend who I try to help out.  She lost her husband a couple years ago.	It's wonderful you have a good friend like that."
"We go out to lunch regularly.  She is depressed and I try and get her out of the house to do things.	That sounds so sweet of you! How has she been coping?"
"Thanks.  Yes she had some mental issues around the time he died but is doing better now.	We need to come together as a country and be united and solve our issues, no matter your views.	I agree with that too"
"Exactly, let's comprimise and decide on things before it's to late!	Yes I agree. There is nothing more important than making our government great again"
"I spent my first Christmas away from home in a computer lab, working by myself.	That must have felt really isolating.  How did you end up doing once you got out of the house?"
"Yes, it wasn't very fun.  But I had to do it because my project for work was due the next day.	I bet that was very lonely!  Did you get used to not having anyone to talk to?"
"I miss my dog Kat	What happened to your dog Kat?"
"Yes she was a wonderful black lab who died last year.  She was a great dog	I'm so sorry to hear about your dog. I had a black lab who passed away recently too. They really are great pets. What breed was she?"
"Thanks.  I do miss coming home to her.  My cat is just not the same.	It's great to see my husband doing so well.	What's he doing so well?"
"He's become the top manager in his division in just two years.	That's amazing, congrats"
"Hello, I am very upset about the abuse of some people with their pets ... it is unacceptable	What abuse are you referring to"
"I feel that pain ... as if I had been hit	That is very sad. I have had that happen once before as a parent who really wanted their dog back!"
"it's something since I was born ... I'm like that	That reminds me of the time I went to LA for vacation with my family. I wanted to meet people so I went hiking in the mountains but it soon became dark.	Oh no, did the hostiles start following you?"
"Yea it probably wasn't the smartest decision but at the end I meat a nice group. They eventually helped me from that situation also.	that's cool.  I haven't been back to los Angeles in about 8 years"
"I really miss my puppy, we got her a statue for the backyard to remember her always.	Aw, that's sad. I know what you mean. Pets are really precious and they become a part of the community."
"Yes, she was very old. It was a great tribute to her life.	Aww, I love animals! They're so sweet."
"my son is teething and he is so cranky! I gave him tylenol and got some teething toys. I don	i hope he starts to get better!"
"it is! his molars are coming so he is inconsolable! Doesn't sleep good, doesn't want to eat. poor little boy	Oh my gosh that's so awful! I can relate, my girls get irritated when they have to get their teeth pulled and it is horrible for them!"
"i was trying to sleep train my son but i failed. i didn't it's gonna be that hard. I think we will be co sleeping till he goes to college	Oh no. Maybe he could take some melatonin."
"I hope so, i miss sleeping in a comfortable position without baby feet in my face	Oh no I bet it's painful and hard! I have two children and the first time I put a diaper on I almost passed out! But you are right it's so much easier when the first time is just like waking up!"
"I have been seeing pictures of friends of mine traveling around Italy.	Wow. Have you asked them where they are?"
"I wish I were with them.  I love Italy	Have you seen them in a while, by yourself or on vacation?"
"Oh wow!  You are missing out.  I love traveling and seeing the world.	I am so glad we have the technology to travel"
"That is true but there is something to be said about seeing other cultures	My friend bought me lunch today	Was it a good lunch?"
"I had a nice burger and fries	That was nice of them."
"Yes I was appreciative that she wanted to buy me lunch	I hate when people pull in front of you, especially when it's clear behidn you.	I do too! I get so anxious just staring at other drivers!"
"Had to slam my brakes. I don't get people at all.	brakeslamming brakes sucks!"
"yes, sadly I easily can.	I know i'm an adult but I'm very scared of the dark. i have a good imagination so i always see something creepy	Yeah, I get scared of the dark a little, too. What do you think it is?"
"That's why i can't sleep alone or if i'm alone i always keep the light on	I think most people feel the same, even if it's not as bad as the movies make it out to be."
"I like to help at the animal shelter walking the dogs. They get a chance to get out of their cages and be with a nice human like me.	That is awesome. I wish I had more people like you."
"They do. They get to smell the grass, they play they get their exercise, they get to have fun, they get to be a dog!	You sound like a great person"
"Last night at like midnight the power cut out completely on my street	Wow, that sounds like it was very unfortunate, did you find out why?"
"We luckily had candles around! I was so worried cause it was so fast it was like someone cut our power	Oh wow, that is scary! I bet you were very worried. I would have been if my power did that too. Glad candles helped you figure it out."
"A while back my cat knocked over and broke my mothers urn.	Oh no, did you ask her to leave the furniture by itself, or to replace it?"
"I was so mad for the longest time but I've gotten around to not being so made about it	I am sorry to hear that."
"I made a bowl of cereal for breakfast and when i started eating i realized milk was spoiled!! I started gagging. it was so gross!	That must of been so disgusting!"
"don't you hate that? gosh, i didn't eat anything the whole day because i don't have an appetite anymore	Oh my god, that is crazy! Did anyone else hear this happen to them?"
"I was so calm and happy the other night just listening to rain hitting the kitchen windows	That is nice, it is very calming listening to rain."
"It was the single most calming thing! I love the sound of rain on a tin roof too!	That does sound like a nice sound"
"i got in a car accident 2 months ago and now i get so anxious every time i need to drive somewhere	Oh my gosh! Are you ok?"
"not yet. i'm so broke i can't even afford it. I had to buy a new car and my premiums went up	Oh no that's so awful. Were you okay, or are you still messed up?"
"Though the odds are against you, I understand why people gamble. I remember a particular time I was playing video poker at a local dive bar.	I've never played video poker before. I think I would like it, though."
"Well, take this with a grain of salt, but it CAN be a blast. I put in $5 like I usually do, and on the first deal, I hit $1000. I went nuts, cashing out immediately and started shoving $20 bills in to everyone's hands and pockets!	I would have been way too drunk to even try that lol."
"I honestly think New Orleans is one of the most exciting places to live in the US. You never know what you are going to find around the corner.	Definitely! I visited a month ago and really had a blast! I was shocked at just how much things change around the city each year! Makes it feel smaller than it really is!"
"Mardi Gras is great, but stuff happens every day. One time I was showing some friends around from out of town, and we heard some voices on the other side of a fence. We ducked through a hole, and found a bar with a full band playing - complete with couples swing dancing!	That sounds amazing! I live right outside of New Orleans and it is a pretty awesome city! I'm so happy you guys made it out there!"
"I hate when you go out on a limb for someone and they turn around and burn you for it. You know what I mean?	Yes, what a terrible situation."
"You can say that again. One time, I loaned a friend a bike to get to work and back. A couple weeks later I heard he stopped going to work and had pawned the bike for drug money.	Oh wow that is horrible! Are you ok financially? That sounds like a real low blow."
"1	Sorry?"
"sorry that was sent by an mistake	Thanks for the apology!  I'm not that mean!"
"I don't think I am a judgmental person, but we all have our limits. I stayed on my girlfriend's friend's homestead for a day, and I can still smell it.	Why did you go on a homestead anyways?"
"Trust me, this place was out of control. They had the pig pen and the chicken coup within a stones throw of the main house. To top it off, they had running clean water, but no toilet indoors!	I don't think I know where you live. Here in the U.S., we don't have a absurd amount of toilet paper, yet somehow we managed to get so much worse than the U.K."
"I just finished working on a presentation that I'm supposed to give tomorrow.	How do you think it went? Are you nervous?"
"I feel pretty good about it.  I've spent the last two weeks crunching numbers about our holiday projections.	Sounds like a good presentation. How long did it take?"
"I'll find out at Christmas.  Considering all the numbers I looked at, the possibility looks good!	Sometimes you know your friends better than even their long term roommates know them. Have you ever been in that situation?	Of course. It's not a fun situation. But it's happened. I'm not sure I want to go into it too much detail. What do you mean?"
"That's definitely true! I am thinking of one person in particular to be honest. We waited all night at her house for her to join us so we could make this party. She never showed!	I totally know what you are talking about. I had a roommate who was a terrible girlfriend. Her husband was cheating on me and I saw him cheating on me too. I was beyond devastated."
"Not too long ago, my mother unexpectedly paid off a high monthly payment and interest loan! I couldn't believe it!	That's wonderful! I have never been able to do that!"
"Yes, I didn't have a clue she was going to do it and it was very much appreciated it.She's always so great thought, I am blessed.	that's amazing! you are lucky to have her!"
"I broke a finger the other day and couldn't do any dishes! It was terrible	Did you go to the kitchen and fix it?"
"I was super lucky though because my husband just went up and did them all for me!	I bet that was a nice feeling"
"So I managed to get all my school shopping done this week so the kids have all their things ready to go for tomorrow!	Oh yeah? What are your plans?"
"I got an early start this year.  Most years I start late and they're out of stuff I need by the time I get around to it.	that's a great feeling, huh? I'm sure they're excited to go school shopping together."
"And then the stores get so crowded after a certain point!	That is why its best if stores get really busy during holidays."
"I think next year I'm going to start early but just do everything online.  All the stores in town were absolute messes today!	I was having a bad day the other day and everything just kept going wrong	That's never a good thing to hear! What was going on? Hopefully you didn't take it too personally?"
"The worst part of the day though was when I dropped my last cookie I was really looking forward to	What flavor of cookie was it"
"I fought off hordes of people shopping for school stuff all at the same time and I won!  I got everything on their lists!	Awesome! Congratulations! That's such a satisfying feeling, especially coming up with new things to buy!"
"YES.  *chuckle!*  School starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane.  The worst part was, usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no, not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!	That's wonderful!  The worst thing that can happen is people getting mad at you for not doing your job well, and that's never fun for either parties involved."
"I have to grocery shop on Thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down.  But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year, I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!	I can imagine.  It is so nerve wracking and annoying.  I am glad you are getting it all done though."
"Especially since I was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!	Oh yeah! I have to do the same thing this week! It's so nerve-wracking and it makes you feel like you're not getting what you want!"
"The other day I was getting a glass out the cabinet and There sat a spider	Oh my god! Did it jump on you!"
"I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that!	Oh my god! You have such a temper! Were you scared?"
"It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater, but this ""play"" I went to recently was a little too much.	I'm not a fan either, but why too much? Were there too many people, too? Were there too many jokes made at the end?"
"Well, to their credit, they had advertised it as being quite interactive. A little contact is OK, but they wanted me to eat ""mystery candy"" from a box while blindfolded!	I would have totally been in their seats screaming and running."
"Around this time of the year, my husband usually always gets a large bonus, but it's not a promise. It's not easy waiting to see if he will!	How large is he usually getting?"
"It all depends, but always has been thousands. So, the waiting drives us nuts!	What are your plans?"
"When my friend told me to give him my last $400, I thought he was crazy. But in the end, I am glad I did.	What a nice person he must have really got that from you"
"He has these crackpot schemes but they always work out. We turned that $400 in to $2000 a piece selling posters at a music festival!	Wow...that's crazy. But you did the right thing."
"Not all of my high-school memories are fond ones. Like the time I drank too much and passed out at a party.	Oh no, do they still make fun of you at parties"
"I was about 16 at the time. The thing is, I passed out right in front of the entrance to the house. Everyone coming and going had to step over me!	Oh no! How embarrassing! I bet everyone forgot about it."
"I don't know how you are with Calc, but I can get pretty anxious before an exam.	I am not great with math either"
"Me neither! That's why I was amazed when this girl said she had made a study guide and would e-mail us all a copy. I ended up with a B!	I can understand that, I am not great at math."
"My cat kept doing her best to wake me up last night	Did she want to make you believe something was really up with you?"
"She was trying to wake me up to get me to play with her!	awe is it a kitten?"
"I never thought I would be where I am today. If you would have told me I would go back to school at 27, I would have thought you were crazy.	What made you decide to do that?  In a good or bad way"
"I had always wanted to be an electrical engineer, but had settled for life in the service industry (not knocking it). I re-taught myself basic algebra, and was accepted to a state university two years ago!	Wow, congratulations! That sounds like a lot of fun. You should be proud."
"i was so stressed when i found out that i did not get accepted in my dream college	That is horrible! I'm so sorry! What will you do?"
"yeah i got into another college that was not as good haha	Oh man! What are you waiting for?"
"My boyfriend cancelled our date last week to go to the movies with his female best friend...	That's kinda mean."
"Annoyed. I feel like he chooses her over me a lot. I hate feeling like I have to compete with her.	That's such an awful feeling! Maybe you both can meet up online?"
"i cant believe the growth video games are having this past couple of years	I used to like growing up, not so much after seeing the gross mutilation of adult life."
"gaming has blown up this past couple of years	I used to love playing video games but Ive been busy with work"
"I love roller coasters, but I hate that my favorite amusement parks close during the winter.	I'm the same way!  They're so much fun during the holidays but theroid is the best in the winter"
"Not that I'm aware of. :( When February rolls around, all I can think about is how much I miss them and how I can't wait to go back.	That is a shame, but I suppose we can always look forward to them coming back soon."
"I'm excited to graduate college and start my career soon! I have a feeling that my life will get much better once I do.	What are you going to study"
"I'm an Engineering major, electrical engineering specifically. And yourself?	I'm an engineer as well! I'm a computer science major. What about you?"
"i really am thankful for everything that i have and had	What have you got going on?"
"it is actually a little medal my dad gave me when i was little	What does the medal look like? A fat ole manly bummed face, or happy, or sad?"
"he gave it to me beafore he went to the army, and when he came back i showed it to him and it was really emotional	My little brother has gotten really good at bowling recently and it kind of floors me!	My little brother is getting better and better, Is this a sign of things coming  together?"
"Perhaps! He's joining the high school bowling team so that may help his chances as well. Do you like to bowl yourself?	I love bowling. I used to when I was little but I haven't been in forever. Maybe it's time to get back in too it"
"I keep hearing strange noises in my house. My husband is out of town and I'm all alone. There has been reports of break ins on my street.	that is really creepy, is there someone else in the house?"
"No I don't, I do have two dogs! They keep growling at the noises to!	Oh my god. Have you called animal control?"
"So I suck hard at bowling, but tonight I tried to be pro and putting spin on the ball. I ended up just throwing it down the lane instead.	You can learn to do it better, I'm sure"
"Yeah, my face was bright red when the ball almost went into the other lane! Thankfully there was somebody that sucked even worse than me in my party.	That's ok. You can always improve!"
"I have a very good friend and her boyfriend made sexual advances towards me. I never did tell my friend, for various reasons, but I feel really guilty and bad about it@!	Oh my goodness. I would feel awful bad too. You don't have to tell anyone, but you can't just let it ruin your friendship over something like this!"
"Yes, and there were financial and personal reasons of her own that is why I didn't tell her. Plus, I really hated to hurt her, but I guess I should have told her.	Sometimes, it's just best if you keep it secret for awhile."
"I still live and work in the place where I grew up, but all of my friends have moved away.	Aw, that's sad, maybe you can move back?"
"No, everyone's so busy with their lives and work that it's hard to arrange. Most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night, so I keep to myself at home, alone.	I am sure you miss your family."
"So college is starting up soon and I'm worried I won't be able to deal with the workload again.	I remember when mine were first offered they had to wait a couple weeks approval.  I believe its much better for them to be rushed now rather than later."
"I wanna say 14 credit hours for engineering classes. I have a part time job too I work 20 hours a week at.	That does sound hard, but if you have the time you should be able to get through it."
"So college is starting up soon and I feel more ready than ever to do well this year!	It's good to have the time ahead to make sure you do everything you want to do."
"Thanks, I'm going to try! Last semester wasn't bad but I procrastinated more than I should have.	College sucks! I hope everything works out for you!"
"So I just had an amazing dinner and am now relaxing in my room. I feel very at ease.	That's awesome! What did you have?"
"Surprisingly enough, a pizza from the bowling alley. I never said that I was picky!	I'm glad you had a great meal and a good night! Pizza's are so much fun!"
"my son is teething really bad and he is so inconsolable that breaks my heart. i can't wait till these molars cut thru	Aw, I'm sorry. That sounds painful and really hard to deal with. I can only imagine the agony you're going through."
"I do but he doesn't like them. he can barely eat his mouth hurts so bad	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope he'll recover!"
"I think I will be very busy Monday night playing my new game.	What game is that?"
"World of warcraft. I'v got a deeper reason then it being a game- it's how i meet my husband.	Oh I've never played that before! Have fun mowing lawns or building castles!"
"I come home from work and my parents always seem to be arguing. It's very frustrating.	That is not good.  Have they tried to have a peaceful talk about it"
"Yes they do. They act like children and I am essentially the most mature/responsible one in the house.	That is so annoying! I'm glad you work with parents who are good"
"I think storms are wonderful, except when the power goes out.	I hate powerouts! Especially when it's raining."
"It was extra loud and my husband was at work, bit scary.	I live in Florida, so we deal with power outages a lot.  We lost one tonight, and it was just as bad as the ones we had last year!  Luckily I live close enough to the house that we didn't have to deal with it, but it was still very scary!"
"O it sure seemed like it did, dogs were scared too.	College is starting soon and I'm feeling like I'll be able to stay on top of homework this semester!	That's great when it's pay off.  homework?  what's that?"
"It probably will be, as I'm studying engineering. I feel confident that I won't procrastinate as much this time though!	That's good. I am in the same boat. I am getting the same amount of homework as the last semester but I am having so much fun."
"I recently heard a music artist for the first time in a long time that brought me back to my childhood.	Oh that's cool! What kind of music?"
"It sure was! I enjoy reliving the memories, things were often simpler and more carefree back then.	What kind of memories did they remind you of?"
"So I consider myself a decent bowler but my brother came out of nowhere, he's actually really skilled. I'm kind of shocked actually.	What kind of bowler?"
"For sure. I am here doing the traditional bowling style and he is spinning the ball across the lane getting strikes often. He makes me look bad!	Thats cool. I would be so proud of my brother too"
"I am so nervous to start my new job tommorrow.	Why's that? Must be pretty scary."
"it's a desk job. Its my first time in a place like this.	Well I wish luck and success with your new job! What kind of desk is it?"
"So I had a customer sign the wrong form today. I feel kind of bad because I'll have to have them sign the right thing next time and I'll look incompetent.	That's a bummer, but I've done it before so you never know"
"For sure, that is a silver lining. Mistakes happen I suppose, can't expect to be perfect!	They are going to have a talk with you. Mistakes happen but if you had the correct information they would not have been so big of a deal to you."
"So I went on a road trip to Utah a few months ago after my friends backed out. It was awesome but I did miss them.	Ah, that's always hard when you don't see them for a few days. Were there any cool aspects to the trip?"
"No I didn't get around to that area! I did visit Arches and Canyonlands national parks though. Even though I was by myself, would do again!	That's cool. Maybe I should do the same."
"So my brother got my dream vehicle as his first car. I am feeling a certain way about this!	Well, that's exciting for him! But a little sad for you."
"I don't think so actually, I haven't let him know that I love that type in particular so much haha. I am definitely wishing it was mine though!	I would be so excited for you.  Maybe its for the best."
"So I want to buy a new vehicle but I'm nervous about pulling the trigger on it.	Get researching what kind of payment plan you want and then try to research what payment options you want."
"Yep. Like, my current car is dying, but I almost literally want to drive it until it no longer runs at all.	I understand that completely. It's scary to think what other drivers might do to you!"
"PEople are crazy now a days. I watched people try to take a gas can from my yard!	I saw one try to take a can of RAID on my way to work. It was horrifying!"
"It was during a power outage during a hurricane,  still made me mad.	Oh wow. Gas cans are very destructive tools for a lot of people."
"So my car wouldn't start today after work. I kind of hate my car!	That's awful. Are you able to start things up for tomorrow? Hopefully something similar will come around"
"Oh yes, very old. It's a 2002 and while I've had it for 6 years now, I'm finally starting to grow tired of it.	That's too bad, are you planning to sell it or keep it for a collection?"
"I hate giving big presentations and being the center of attention.	Me too, especially in front of people."
"I know! Like, mentally, I don't care, but my body just responds by making my legs shake, my heart pound, and speaking too quickly.	I totally get you.. It is a very social situation.. I have social anxiety too"
"I had to dogsit for my dad about a week ago. I had to clean up dog poop at least 10 times, it was awful.	wow that does not sounds pleasant!"
"Oh yes. I wish I could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them, but I would be lying.	lol i dont think dogsitters are that hard."
"So I was listening to rap in my car with the windows down. The people in the car next to me were just staring at me. It was kinda awkward.	Did you say anything?  Did you say anything?"
"Yeah, not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.	Haha, that would be embarrassing."
"I was really worried about how I'd afford textbooks this semester.	What textbooks do you need?"
"Yes, everything's taken care of, thanks to my boyfriend-- he surprised me with all of the books I needed!	That's awesome! What are the books he got you?"
"i was really glad i finished my service for the military	I bet. Those who finish before the service are often called invalids"
"it is a pleasure i am really proud i did this for my country	That's great! What was it like?"
"i did not expect my car to be soo good for the price i paid	That sounds awesome. What kind of car did you get?"
"yeah it was a used car i was not expecting much but it turned out really well	Awesome, what kind of car did you get?"
"i don't like to see my parents smoke it makes me really sad	Why is that exactly? Do you think it's unhealthy for you to see them smoking or just that you don't like their smoking?"
"yeah but it has turned into a normal thing now	Why is it so bad now?"
"i hate when ash from my cigarette drops in my work pants	I know right? It is so uncomfortable."
"yeah, i haave to wait till i get home to get the stain off, it is really embarrasing	I am sorry that you had to experience that."
"When katrina hit texas my family lost like half of their belongings	That is so sad! Are they ok?"
"Well when it hit we left but now we are ok and we recovered well	That is terrible, I cannot imagine how you feel."
"i cant stand people that dont flush the toilet	Oh my gosh! Really! Why do you have to flushing the toilet so often?!"
"Oh, so where do you go to do your personal buisness	Flush the toilet at your house. Problem solved."
"I guess i will be the next team leader	what do you plan to do to become such an owner?"
"Yes. I was expecting that very much.	What sport are you talking about?"
"My kids and I went to Six Flags and they wanted me to ride the roller coaster but I had so many reservations about getting on it.	What happened if I may ask."
"The high speeds. It had been so long since i had been on one. I finally did get on and we had a blast!	I love riding rollercoasters! They are so much fun! Did you have a good time?"
"When I turned 40 last year, my kids planned a birthday party for me that I had no idea about.	That was thoughtful of them! Did you get lots of presents?"
"It really was and just what I need as I wasn't really happy about turning that corner into my 40's.	That's pretty cool.  It's nice when the older you are, the simpler the things seem"
"A few weeks ago we were at a wedding. Everyone was dancing and having fun and all of a sudden my 3 year old niece started to choke on a carrot. So scary!	Oh no, I bet that was scary! Did she end up choking on the carrot herself, or was it the other end?"
"Yes, someone was able to do the Heimlich maneuver and she was ok right after that. It was quite the panic for a few minutes though.	Oh no!  Did anyone help you pull her back up after she choked?"
"So an online payment distributor company won't instantly verify my bank account even though the login info is correct. Feels bad man.	That would make me nervous, what about calling them to see what the issue is>"
"Nope. I even double checked the login info and signed into my bank's website no problem. I feel a bit let down.	did they at least give you a little cash for the inconvenience?"
"Today is my off day and I wanted to sleep in, yet here I am awake early.	Being a mom I understand.  Sometimes it is good to be a littleggy and just lay in"
"It sucks. I guess my body doesn't want me to sleep in any more.	Beach day?"
"I was dog sitting at my dad's house last week and I heard strange noises in his house.	Oh, no! Did anything happen or did you figure it out?"
"I don't know, it was very odd. I would go in the kitchen and the sink would be running a little bit even though I didn't turn it on. Kind of spooky.	Haha that must have taken a while to piece together! Sounds like something out there in your neighborhood?"
"Last semester, I had to give a class presentation. My stomach was full of butterflies from the nerves.	That is a great stress in your body! Was it hard?"
"All things considered, pretty well. I definitely had some anxiety about it though. Presentations are my least favorite thing in the world.	That's too bad. What was your presentation about? I'm glad your stomach felt so full!"
"My aunt recently passed away after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease.	Sorry for the loss."
"Thanks. It's been especially hard because she was almost like a mother to me.	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about that! My aunt is getting better everyday. I hope she still has some great years left!"
"So I asked out a girl in my class and she said yes. Was a big morale boost.	That is awesome, It is nice to feel confident."
"Thanks! We are getting coffee this weekend. Hopefully something comes of it!	Cups are always good.  That's great news.  What kind of coffee did you get?"
"I always carry a multi-tool and a small 4-1 screwdriver on me. I feel like I can fix almost anything with that.	that's awesome. It always feel like you have so much more room to tool around"
"I'd like to think so. I just like to be ready for anything.	Multi tools are awesome. Are they useful in the kitchen? As in how to properly apply, or how to use them?"
"I'm starting a new position at my job soon.	Congratulations!  What position is it?"
"I'll be managing consumer relations at a law firm. I'm really looking forward to it!	that sounds exciting, are you nervous?"
"My car is on it's last legs. I think I see a new car in my future very soon.	What kinda car is it?"
"I would love to get an X-Terra! I'm a big fan of the SUV platform.	Oooh I really like the new SUV platform! You must love the car"
"After dropping out of college 6 years ago, I decided to go back this year.	Wow, 6 years is coming to an close. Did you graduate 6 years?"
"I have high hopes for myself, as I have all A's so far. I hope I can keep up the momentum!	What college you went to"
"I just had a delicious breakfast and now I'm casually relaxing in my room. Life is good!	Good life is a great place to be!"
"Pancakes and sausage! How can you go wrong?	You're so lucky! I need some pancakes too now. What kind of sausage did you have?"
"So I have been saving money for about a month now and should have enough for any kind of emergency that may happen. Feels good man.	Emergency? What happens if an emergency come up? Do you have a boat?"
"Thanks so much! It definitely relieves some stress knowing that I have a safety cushion. Hoping I don't have any emergencies though!	Emergency money is always nice. What kind are you saving?"
"Having a baby 3 months ago really changed my view on life for the better.	What changed your view?  I'm curious.  Is it something that you're excited to get out of the ordinary, or that you're excited to see birth?"
"I was a heavy drinker, and looking back now, I know I was in a downward spiral, I just couldn't tell at the time. Now I'm pursuing my education and have become much more healthy and responsible.	Thats awesome.  Congratulation"
"My husband and I are going a  cruise with a couple that we have been friends with for a long time,	That's great!  cruises are so much fun!  Where are you guys headed to??"
"We kind of all came up with it together. They booked it and we just pay them a certain amount of money each week, until our part is paid for.	That's really cool. Where is the cruise headed?"
"I hope you can too. If its ok, I would like to pray for you, just to maybe help you find someone special.	I am so proud of my sister	That's awesome. Is she working hard to get better at everything?"
"She bought me a car	She must be a pretty good driver."
"We are basically best friends. It is my birthday and she worked really hard to get a car for me	Well that was nice of her!"
"I am sad that my parents didn't attend my birthday	I would be sad too. Why didn't they invite you?"
"No, they just are not wanting to come to it	I am sad that your parents didn; t attend my birthday No, they just are not want to come to it"
"Last week at the end of the week I got home from work and was pretty tired.  I ended up just sitting on the couch with my wife and dogs watching tv.  It was nice.	That sounds relaxing!  What do you usually do that time?"
"Quite a lot, actually.  It was a nice way to spend the evening.	I love watching tv with the dogs too. We have an old country show that I love to watch as well!"
"I was going to a wedding outside of my city, and had arranged to have my dogs watched while I was gone, but the person backed out really soon before I had to leave.	Wow! Did you have them for a while?"
"Something like that, they were vague.  It was through a company so I couldn't really get much out of them.  Luckily a friend stepped up and watched them for me.	Oh thank god! That's a relief! Did you have the wedding at some fancy restaurat?"
"I was tired last night and my wife was out of town, so I went to bed early.  I ended up lying with my dogs in bed for a while watching TV before falling asleep.	That's a good strategy."
"A wire haired dacshund and a shephard mix thing	That is adorable."
"My wife has been out of the country for school for a month and a half.  She gets back in a couple weeks, and it's getting tougher to wait.	Where has she been"
"I do, every night.  It's still hard going from having someone around every day to never, but I'll get through.	I am sure you will get through it."
"My dad was cleaning out his attic when he found a box of my old stuff from childhood	dad's are awesome like that!"
"I did! He found my favorite childhood book of mine and I just sat there thinking about all the memories	Aww that is really cool of him. Did he get a good feel of your stuff?"
"My wife is out of the country for school, and the other day she was having a really bad day.  I couldn't really do anything to help, and it made me feel bad.	Aw :( I know how that feels. I hope she'll be back soon to visit?  What did you do?"
"Thanks, that's actually really helpful.  It's been tough being apart for so long, we haven't been apart more than a couple days since we started dating.	I bet you will get through it."
"I almost got into a fight the other day at a store.	Oh no. What happened?"
"A guy budged in front of some other people, I confronted him about it, and we got into an extremely heated exchange.	What an extremely heated exchange? A fight where people are fighting over silly things? I hope both people are okay!"
"No, the guy eventually backed off and left, albeit not before he flipped me off a few times and called me numerous names.	For a while my husband was really sick with the flu	I'm glad he got well! Did you guys get well, too?"
"He is but I just felt so much love for him because there wasn't anything he could do	That's a good thing.Love and health are more important than money sometimes!"
"When people make me wait, i get really anxious	Why? Is it because they think they are being patient or maybe you are anxious about them in general"
"Not really, i just look at the clock and wait for the time to come and when they dont arrive in time i start getting anxious	I do that too, it's annoying"
"I love dogs very much they are always great companions	Dogs are the best! What kind do you love the best?"
"I got a puppy not to long ago and love him with all my heart	Oh I'm happy for you! It's good to find someone who can love animals!"
"My cat broke her leg not too long ago and had to have surgery one it	aww.. that's sucks. How old is your cat now?"
"I was lucky cause I know my vet personally so I only paid 175 usd I was so scared for her	Oh no! I'm so glad it didn't end worse for her! I had to have an ancer repaired in my other cat and it ended up worse for me because it was more healing process. I hate cats that are too clingy."
"there was a shooting in a gas station near me i was really devastated	gas station? that sounds awful"
"im not sure but there was 2 victims i was devastated	gas station? that's awful. shooting in a store? even more so."
"I was sad when my dog died	I'm sorry to hear that, how long did you have it for?"
"I had him for 10 years. It's just so hard because he was my whole world	Oh no I'm sorry, how was he?"
"I am so lonely because I am all by myself	How come you alone so much?"
"I appreciate that. It's just tough because I go daily without talking to anyone. It's nice to talk to someone	I am very lonely also."
"i was really jelous when i say my  neighboor had a new 2018 Bmw convertible	Wow.  That's cool!   Is that even legal though?"
"yeah it is i wish i could have a car like that	That's awesome!  I wish I had a new car.  I have an old clunker from the 90s that still works... runs good as new.  It's nice to have the peace of mind to just not worry about payments on bills and worry about making money on the side hustle."
"I am sad that my friends dont visit me	Why is that?"
"I don't have a car and they live far away	Oh wow that's quite the distance, are they busy or do they not have time to make it?"
"I am disgusted that my food didn't come out the way I wanted it	Disgust? What is wrong with your cooking?"
"It was burnt and not appealing	That's a shame, what kind of food was it?"
"when i was young i hit a car on the parking lot and did not say anything'	Oh no, did it leave you feeling guilty?"
"i did not see any marks on the other car and was running late	Oh no! Did you ever end up apologizing?"
"My sister is so caring, she took care of me when I was sick	That's awesome! It sucks that you had to use your sister for sick days though, was she able to do anything about it?"
"That is so true. I am so very thankful	That is very nice of her! You must have felt very lucky that day."
"I heard this god awful howling the other night at like 2am right outside my window	Who was it?"
"It was! I was so scared to be honest with you! The worst part is that I don't own a dog either	Haha, that would be the worst worst thing ever. I rescue, so if I were you I'd be running around in circles trying to figure out where it came from! What did it sound like?"
"I was surprised when my mom bought me a car	That was so nice of her! What kind of a car?"
"Its a ford mustang	That's awesome! My mom got me a Ford raptor! What a lovely surprise!"
"I am very ashamed in my family	I'm sure they're not the only ones. Why do you feel ashamed?"
"Because they never invite me to go places, and they never call me	I'm so sorry, that must be hard.  Do they think it is because of you?"
"I am disgusted because of my friends pulling pranks on me	Oh no. What happened?"
"I dont know. They have been my friends for so long but these pranks are just making me mad	Friends don't pull pranks. They pull on someone else."
"I was afraid when I got out of the movie theater	Were you? How was it?"
"I was watching a horror film and then I had to walk home alone in the dark	Horrible, was it a scary movie at least"
"I am very faithful that my family will make it home in time	Where did they go?"
"They are in Cuba	Wow, that's a big place to be for family! Cuba is one of my favourite places to visit!"
"I am terrified that my wife is going to leave me	Why do you think that is?"
"Because she is talking to other men behind my back	Why wouldn't she want to do that?"
"I am sad that I won't get to see the movie I want to see	Awh, that's terrible. What movie is it?"
"I wanted to see the First Purge	Oh no that's sad! I hope you get to go soon enough!"
"Because I didn't have a ride to the movies	We just got back from the beach two weeks ago. It was such a lovely vacation. We loved relaxing on the beach and just taking it easy.	i love taking the time to relax as well. it's hard for me to put off house work for long periods of time"
"It was very nice. There was a day or two of rain, but mostly perfect weather!	That's great! The perfect weather is the best.  Was it nice and clear, or was it rainy and hailing?"
"My husband and I are going on our very first cruise in December.	wow that is so fun! where are y'all going??"
"To the Caribbean Islands. We are going with another couple that we have been friends with for a very long time.	Caribbean islands...I have never heard of them...I am so jealous, how many people do you have?"
"Thanks, me too.	The other night I was just craving candy. I ate up all that we had!	uhoh, did someone call the poison hotline?"
"Sometimes you just have to! It felt so great then but I hated it the next morning!	I have had such bad chocolate problems in the past. Did you have any left?"
"My husbands cancer free now!	That's great!  Cancer free? That's incredible!  How long did it take to completely remission, and how long did he battle the disease?"
"Congrats! We are hoping right now that nothing comes back but It's so happy	That's fantastic news! Cancer isn't something that's easy."
"I'm so frustrated with my husband. He dismantled the bathroom to do repairs and still hasn't completed them six months later!	That's just crazy! Do you think he is crazy?"
"He promised he would complete it within a month and since it's been so long, I called a contractor today!	Wow, that's a real ""gotcha."" I'd be frustrated as well."
"I've got a job interview set up for next week and I'm really nervous!	Those butterflies can be really bad! Just stay positive!"
"I hope so! I bought a couple books on preparing for interviews and I've done a couple mock interviews with a friend.	That's great! I'm sure you'll do great!"
"My parents always argue and it pisses me off!	That's not nice.  Have they talked to you about it recently?"
"I have but they rarely listen. They act like children and it can get frustrating. What can you do?	Tell them to be quiet and maybe try to have a conversation.  If it bothers them go to their room"
"Sometimes life just gives you lemons. At an old job of mine, I had what will probably remain the worst performance review of my life.	I am sorry, how did it happen?"
"I'm not sure it was really about my performance at all. I was surprised by the presence of my only adversary there, and informed that a large part of my position would be dissolved, and I would be answering phones.	That sounds so sad. You must feel terrible and lonely."
"That's must be a relief for you.  I am assuming you have children?	No I dont. But its a huge relief for my marriage and my life"
"So I guess that sending anyone off to school is not a big deal to you?  Do you attend school?	I do have children. Yes I attend college. And no I do not attend college."
"Do you have something you are looking forward to?	My father passed away about 2 1/2 years ago. It was totally unexpected and really was very traumatic and hurtful to me. He was still quite young and my family and I had no idea he had a life threatening health issue.	I'm so sorry for your father, but it's good to hear that he has some great friends who he had no clue about. Life changing illnesses are really tough."
"I was pretty close to my father and always lived close by. But, you always wish you had more time. But, the last words I said to him was that I loved him, and I'm grateful for that.	I know what you mean.  Its hard when you are not sure how much time will pass by.  Life really does seem to mirror itself, doesn't it?"
"Once when I was younger I went to a friends 16th birthday and had a crazy experiene happen	16th? That's young! What happened?"
"we were walking in the front door and it had a glass door apparently but I didn't see it.  It was a very clean door.  LOL.  Later on that night I won a door prize.  which was pretty funny]	That's so crazy! Did it make you cry, too?"
"My daughter caught me in a bad mood the other day and was being a bit argumentative. I lost my temper, yelled and really hurt her feelings. I felt bad that it happened.	That's awful. I hope it didn't lead to something more serious."
"Yes, I was already not in a good mood, and then it seemed like she just pushed the right button. But, I knew I shouldn't have done it as soon as I saw the look in her eyes, I felt very bad.	That sounds awful.  What was it?"
"You never know what someone else is going through, and looks can be deceiving. Like this old man that seemed like any other drunk.	oh wow! Thats crazy! What did he look like, if you don't mind me asking?"
"It was hard to tell honestly, but it turned out the guy was lost and diabetic. He had lost track of his friends and had no way to get home, so I hailed him a cab and paid the driver $20.	That's really awesome of you.  I've never had the luck to be that lucky."
"We hadn't been to the beach and years and really wanting to go back for vacation. We were able to a few weeks ago and it was awesome. I was thrilled!	Where did ya'll go?"
"It's was great. The weather was perfect most of the time, and we were able to relax and enjoy it so much. We were really hyped to go!	That sounds amazing! I hope we get a good turn around for our vacation, too!"
"The last time I went to the fair, I tripped over a big cord. This led to me having one of those running falls, that seem to last forever! I wanted to disappear at that moment!	Oh no! That would be horrible. I tripped over that too last year when tripped over an old tree branch. It hurt!"
"Oh no, there were tons of people that noticed lol. I can laugh now, but not at that moment.	That happens to everyone lol"
"I lost a puppy recently and I'm still broken up about it.	Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that! I have lost many pets over the years and know the feeling very well."
"it's never going to be ok, but it will be a little less painful in time.	Oh, I'm so sorry! I know how you feel, I lost a dog years ago and its still hurting!"
"I'm sorry youve been there too.,	It's not fun when a 4 year old does something he shouldnt.	What did he do?"
"Took a small toy, put it in his pocket. took it back to the store and made him return it.	4 yrs old?  Does he have good motor control?"
"Yea, he seems to get it now.	As a mom I sometimes sneak a sweet treat when I make it out alone.	Do you sneak it in so you don't get noticed? Or are you just a regular mom and just want some company?"
"Still feel bad when I got an ice cream the other day	Why do you sneak it out? sneak what?"
"I've had a rough week! The house has been a mess from my dogs and toddler. My husband hasn't been helping out much, its fustrating!	At least the baby hasn't started to eat."
"I'm not sure! He has been busy with work but also has been going out with friends a lot :(	At least you have a roof over your head and some comforts. That is a positive right?"
"My niece made me proud today, graduated from her nursing school.	Congratulations! That's awesome. What is she nursing in school for?"
"YEa, she's over come a lot for it.	That's amazing! nursing is such an amazing career!"
"Since it was my birthday today, when I came home there was a big pink cake and flowers waiting for me :)	That sounds like you really love your birthday! Was it a surprise, or was it a happy birthfay?"
"My husband! I did not see it coming at all, thought we were going to wait till the weekend to celebrate.	Thats sweet! Congrats buddy!"
"We had to clean out our storage building because of roof damage. I found an old box of pictures!	That sounds like a fun project! Did you find anything in there?"
"My family and all kinds of old memories, birthdays, festivals, swimming, and other stuff	That's very nice memories you have there! Did you find any good things in the box?"
"It's so hot and our AC just broke. We had to open the windows to be able to sleep!	AC is so hot where you live? I can barely go to 70!"
"The icing on the sweaty cake was that a giant horse fly kept buzzing around the room and the moment you got comfy would land on you	I hate when I wake up and the AC is broke. That's the worse part."
"I'm so excited! My family and I are moving to a new state at the end of this year!	That is awesome! Are you all going to be able to stay together?"
"That is nice. Having a better paying job is always good.	Awesome! I can't imagine being in a situation where my situation is any better! I hope you guys do well"
"I've got back in to running this week, I missed it! It's a great stress reliever!	That is awesome! running is such a stress relief"
"I love to run, did Track and Field in High School! Right now I'm only running 3 miles till I build my stamina back up! What do you do for excersise?	I used to play tennis but never played it competitively. I'm doing crossfit now and love it!"
"You won't believe the day I've had! I got to sleep in this morning, I haven't done that in months!	Oh no! What was the occasion?"
"Yes, my husband even cooked dinner for me today, and helped clean the house! He has been very helpful today.	That is so sweet!! I bet he felt so good!"
"This has been a great week! Well actually a great year for my family.	Really, since when you were born"
"Thank you, my husband got two great job offers!	Oh wow, that's fantastic news! I'm so happy to hear that and your husband's success is really inspiring. What kind of job did you apply for?"
"My daughter is growing up so fast!	Time flies. Is she your only child?"
"She is 4 and in Pre-school! She is doing so well learning how to share and also knows her colors!	That is so exciting!"
"I live in Central Texas, it rained and lightening stuck a house here and caused it to burn down!	Did you call the police?"
"Yes, I hope the family is okay! No word yet if anyone got hurt.	Wow that's a crazy thing to do. Is your house damaged at all or is it just hard to see in the lightening storms?"
"my baby is sleeping, my house is clean... it's just so nice and peaceful right now	Awww, that is so sweet!"
"i just hope tonight won't be that night when my baby wakes up every 30 minutes	Sweet baby. Enjoy his early life. He is not going to change unless he wants too."
"I feel like a failure, Im suppose to be on a diet but ate too much today!	That happens to the best of us"
"Thanks, I keep telling myself to stick with it but its hard!	Stacking is key."
"I'm thinking about quitting my day job!	Why? What's wrong?"
"My boss has been unreasonable and a pain. He dosen't understand how much time I put into the company!	That's a bummer!  You should definitely do it!"
"Tuesday I got to take my kids to the beach for the first time.	That sounds like so much fun - and of course you must have so much fun planned. How old are your kids?"
"We had a blast! I could barely contain myself on the trip there!	I love the beach! How many kids do you have?"
"My new dog is doing so great, she was potty trained in a week!	Awesome! What typeof dog is she?"
"She is a Jack Russell, she loves to cuddle in my lap.	That is awesome.  My dog is getting potty trained too.  I love how their dogs look up at you and they know you are worried about them lol"
"i moved to a new house recently and miss my old one	Aw, I know how you feel! How is it holding up?"
"10 years, i hope i get to feel the same way i did in my old house	That's great. Maybe your family should visit too?"
"i feel like i am the best player on my soccer team	That's cool, I like soccer. Do you play in the league?"
"yeah i do i am always the one that steps up in the game	You are the best.  You are a player that everyone wishes they could be."
"I've been having anxiety attacks lately. Everything is great and suddenly i start thinking about something bad happening and i have a full blown anxiety attack over something that didn't even happen	That's terrible. You need professional help."
"no, it just started happening. I would say it started a couple of months ago. i will see a doctor in 2 weeks	Well I hope that it gets better."
"We recently went on vacation and it made me feel reminiscent. It made me think of the last vacation I was able to spend with my father before he unexpectedly passed away.	wow thats terrible, i hope it wasn't for the worst! were you okay?"
"Thank you. I don't think it matters how old you are when a parent passes away, it's very painful. The vacation did bring back great memories with him though.	I'm so sorry to hear of your father's passing. It's very painful for a child to watch their grandparents go through this, I know. My mother was in a very similar situation."
"my friend can literally eat junk food all day long and stay skinny! She doesn't even work out. and here i am, eating healthy, working out and still loking fat	Junk food makes you healthy right? It's healthy if you avoid sugar and meat! If you don't eat it all the time, it's just as healthy."
"that's true too! But i just wish i looked like her	Hey, if she can do it all by herself, why shouldn't you?"
"It was my birthday and My friend sent me a birthday card with a gift card in a mail... i never got it, somebody stole it! and we actually have a cluster mailbox so only i can open it. it means that usps worker stole it	That's horrible! I would be so upset if that were me"
"i did, the lady told me they can't do anything about it because it didn't have a tracking number.	That is terrible, I would be so upset"
"My cat was playing last nigh and brought it to me.	Oh, that's mean. Did it wake you up?"
"Well, it wasn't one of his toys like I thought. It was a dead mouse	I bet that was a surprise"
"my son just used a potty for the first time! he is only 16 months. i'm so proud of him	That is such a huge step. It's potty training that will make him a very well mannered person!"
"I know! they  grow up so fast! I feel like i just gave a birth to him and look at him now	I know that feeling of becoming an uncle!  My son is 3 1/2"
"Sometimes things don't work out like you planned. It can be a real let down though.	what happened?"

"My family went on a road trip this week and had to stop at a gas station for the bathroom.	That's always a bit disappointing. What did they end up doing instead?"
"Well the bathroom seemed cleaned but the roaches told me otherwise.	Are you going to tell them the bad things happened?"
"It sounds crazy to say, but even though I was hit by a car on my bicycle, it could have been much worse.	What exactly happened to make it so bad?"
"I'm quite fine now (my knee has a plate and six screws). I am just glad that the driver stopped and called an ambulance!	That's awesome! You must be quite proud of yourself :)"
"It might be, but considering I'm 29 with an artificial hip as well, I've gotten used to being half metal.	Last semester was probably the largest challenge of my life. I go to school for electrical engineering, and I took 6 courses.	Wow, that's quite a feat! You must be very proud. I couldn't even imagine."
"Oh my gosh then you know! I have to say though, it all came out in the wash - 4 As and 2 Bs!	Wow, that's quite the feat! What are you the most passionate about?"
"Waiting for something to come in the mail can send me in to a tizzy. It's even worse when it's parts I need to finish a computer repair job.	Oh man! I am so jealous of you!  What is the worst that can happen?"
"I did get it done in the end. It was a nail biter since the client was leaving the day after the parts came.	Oh man, that's the worst! What kind of computer is it?"
"Have you ever lost control of your bowels as an adult?	yes several times."
"Phew! I'm glad I am not the only one. Although for me, it happened in the middle of dinner at a small Vietnamese restaurant, and an employee walked in on me cleaning my pants in the sink!	Oh wow, that must have been humiliating! I hope you had plenty of coffee to calm your bowels!"
"I went to a heavy metal music festival in Las Vegas a few years ago! I had fun, but to be honest it was a bit of an emotional roller coaster.	Did you get on it after a while?"
"I think it's because everybody can relate when it comes to live music. My girlfriend broke up with me the second day, but we had to stay in the same room.	That's so sad. That would make me so sad too!"
"You know how sometimes things don't go as planned, but it feels like they turn out better in the end?	Sure does. It can feel like you wasted potential sometimes."
"You could call it that! I was supposed to go to a social event, but it got rained out and I ended up watching the rain for hours with my girlfriend.	Rainy days are the best days"
"My father was having abdominal pain, so he went to the hospital and they discovered a tumor.	That's unfortunate.  What is the treatment for it?"
"It was cancerous, but the surgery to remove it seemed to go well. A few days later he passed away suddenly, with no exact cause of death.	Oh my goodness! I can't even imagine what that is like! I hope you have someone to confide in right now!"
"I love it when the new star wars movies come out, seeing all those kids (and adults) dress up for the theater really takes me back!	Yeah I love those too"
"I don't anymore, but when I was a kid, a friend and I dressed up as the hero and the villain for the premiere of Episode I.	That sounds awesome. I used to love the old republic command and conquer movies. They have gotten so old."
"On our second date, my girlfriend and I stopped in a dive bar on our way back from the beach.	That sounds like fun! Did you have a good time?"
"Like a hole in the wall. Cheap drinks, sometimes a little dirty, but altogether relaxed - the opposite of snoody. They had a pool table and I showed her some tricks.	I bet she loved that."
"Yeah, I should have just said that. Honestly though, my favorite places to drink.	Where are you from originally. I'm Filipino."
"My father passed away a few years ago, but I still have my grandfather's watch that he gave to me.	Oh, that's so sweet! I'm sure you cherish having a watch from him like he would always love to have a hand giving!"
"I honestly hope to. Every time I look at it I remember the good times we had together.	Thats really sweet of you. I hope to one day get the same kind of memories from my father."
"Hanging out with old flames can be tricky when you are in a committed exclusive relationship.	I can see why that might be difficult"
"Actually, an ex was in town recently and we went for a drink. She made a pass at me, but I told her to get some rest and went home to my girlfriend.	Oh my, did she take you out drinking with her?"
"going near hights really makes me scared	I thinkights are great! Are you always alone?"
"just instinc i think i have always been afraid of heights	i am glad that you don't afraid to heights, i mean i'm scared i wouldn't make it to them at all"
"During carnival season, there is a big rave at an undisclosed location in the middle of the night.	Sounds wild! What do they usually do in the crowds?"
"They are a lot of fun! I must admit though, I was pretty nervous when the cops showed up to shut it down.	That does sound scary"
"Well, there were only two officers and a couple hundred of us. By the time we were all walking away from the warehouse, I was actually laughing.	my girl friend broke up with me about a month ago	Aww man, that sucks man. I'm sorry."
"we where just not getting along, and did not h ave enough time to see each other	That's really sad to hear about that but also to hear stories like this. Are you guys distant now?"
"yes we are	I was always terrified of haunted houses when I was little.	Me too! Did something happen to make you think so?"
"Glad I'm not the only one! My friend has a birthday in October and she wanted us to go to one as a group. I'm still not sure if I'll go,	October scares me to death. I think I would pass out! LOL. Maybe if I'm being honest with you..I'm still pretty young and haven't had a decent amount of sleep since Halloween, so I don't really know much about them."
"My sister snores really hard every night it is getting really anoying	Why don't you get a dog"
"well it is not really her fault it just makes me angry hahah	How do yo feel about that? Maybe she should consider seeing a counselor?"
"My friend and I spotted a mini-gold course when we were coming back from the next state over.	How cool. Did you go and check it out yourself or were you just happy to see it?"
"I know! We played a round and they let us play a second round for free!	That sounds fun! Did you have a lot of fun playing?"
"I feel excited about our upcoming baby shower	That's fun! Do you have any kids?"
"I'm having a baby boy!	That's awesome! Have you been having a boy for a while, or is this your first?"

"when she left for 3 weeks i was alone	That's unfortunate, where did she go"
"nothing at all. I was kinda depressed	Oh that is depressing. Why were you alone?"
"My Calculus final was no joke! I started studying hard two weeks before the test.	Did you do well in the class?"
"Trust me it all paid off. When I went in to take the test, I was absolutely solid on the material.	Thats great! Did you already have all the answers down?"
"Felt sad when she left for 3 weeks	I'm sure she missed ya'll"
"To see her family. It sucked though because my car had broken down.	That is really bad timing. Are you ok? What happened to your car."
"I am happy with where we are now living	That's a good thing. A lot of people would be happier if their lives were less stress."
"A very nice complex with 3 pools!	thats nice"
"I interviewed for a new job and the interview went really well.	That is good news are you happy now?"
"The interviewer made all the comments you'd expect from a good interview and seemed to respond well to my answers.	That is awesome. Im happy to hear that! Im sure that you got a great answer!"
"Some people are just naturals. The first time I played pool with a friend of mine, she had to beat the guy running the table.	Some people are just born winners."
"I shot so-so, but my friend ended up winning the table and beating 5 guys in a row.	People can be really random like that. I'm glad for you and the pool guy!"
"I didn't receive a scholarship in college that I really wanted despite being qualified for it.	That's unfortunate.  Were you able to find another internship?"
"Yes, I'll still attend but the extra help would've been nice.	That's too bad. You must feel disappointed about that, but maybe there will be another opportunity that you're interested in pursuing."
"I know things will work out in God's perfect timing	That is the best feeling.  I am grateful for it."
"Yes I am. For everything we want for the baby to be gifted to us lol	What things do you want for the baby to be gifted?"
"My sister graduated from college after a long road of persistence and determination.	That's great! What is she going to school for?"
"Yes, she is. My family and I are very happy with her accomplishments.	That's great to hear, I'm really happy for your family as well!"
"I like being alone, but not feeling bad when no one is around to talk to	I can understand being lonely"
"It's true I do need my alone time	I can understand that"
"Dog ate grass and then threw up	That is disgusting. What are you going to do about it/"
"Well she was ok. Shouldn't have been so silly	That's pretty gross! I wonder what got her in the situation to have that happen"
"I am so happy to be having a boy	A who, may I ask? Are you having a boy or girl?"
"Thanks. Yes it is. I already got a crib and baby bath.	That is awesome, I have a boy on the way aswell.  How many kids do you have now?"
"When I was younger, I worked really hard to save up money for a car, but needed a bit more. But on my birthday, my parents paid the rest for me.	That was very nice of them!  You must have felt very happy and relieved!"
"I agree. I really wanted to do it myself, but it's something I'll never forget.	Was it a nice surprise?"
"I recently went on my first international trip by myself.	That must've been exciting. Were you afraid?"
"To visit my family for about 3 weeks, I got married a few years ago and my husband and I live pretty far from them now.	Wow that sounds wonderful!  Did you take lots of pictures?"
"Yes, just very nerve racking dealing with the international flights and passport checks and security checks. Definitely an experience.	I was very proud of her for flying all by herself	Where did she fly?"
"Especially with 2 full suitcases	Where were her parents?"
"I don't generally trust people.	Why is that"
"Upbringing. Dad use to say never trust anyone before I left for school every morning	Why do you not trust people?"
"You just can't trust people any more. My mechanic told me it was going to be $1000 to fix my Jeep.	Wow!  That's nuts!!!  I would be livid if it were me!!!"
"Turns out, nothing much at all. A guy down the street got it running for $100.	Wow! I'm impressed you got it running for that cheap!"
"I am so happy that we're having a baby boy	Congratulations! Boy or girl?"
"Yes it is. I am over the moon	Congratulations! I'm happy for you! When is he?"
"I've just successfully completed my first international flight/trip by myself.	Wow! That's awesome! Where did you guys on your trip?"
"Yes, I got to see my family so it was great! I had to be very organized. The flights and layovers were kind of intense.	Wow! Where did you go?"
"I was so sad to find out what she had done. Found it on her facebook message history..	What a jerk"
"She met up with her ex to return his t-shirt..	That is disappointing.  I hope that she wasn't upset about the shirt being returned.  It was probably for good reason."
"I am currently expecting my first baby, it's a boy!	Congratulations! What is the name?"
"October, right around the corner!	wow that is so awesome! congrats"
"I recently went tubing on a river with my girlfriend and her friends from college.	That sounds like so much fun! How were you the entire time?"
"I had a blast! It's supposedly a four hour float but we were out there for eight!	Wow that does sound like a lot of fun! I've always wanted to go tubing!"
"My girlfriend's dog was a 17 year old Chihuahua who emerged from a bathroom at a party in 1999.	Did you have to run away? That is a horrible dog"
"He just sort of showed up and no one knew where he came from. He passed away recently after running away from our friends farm and being struck by a car.	That is terrible, I know the feel, my friend's dog is a 19 year old Spanish Bichon Friseoise. They say chihuahuas have high anxiety so I'm guessing he was stressed about his life. It's sad to lose such a sweet dog."
"I can't believe my girlfriend was still interested in me after she saw the slum I was living in.	Wow, I am sorry to hear about that. Do you have other women?"
"Something like that. My room was in shambles and the house was falling apart! I was mortified when she asked to come inside.	That is terrible. I am sorry."
"Once after a night on the town, I came home and my room had been ransacked.	What happened?"
"The thing is, my alcoholic room mate was the culprit. He had even thrown some of my belongings in the bathtub!	That would make me mad, did he get a warning?"
"I am expecting my first child. It is going to be a boy! We are preparing the nursery and getting everything in order for his arrival!	Congratulations! I am sure you will be an awesome parent! You have my genes :)"
"Yes, it is!	Congratulation! I am so thrilled for you!"
"A few months back, one of my girlfriend's close friends died from a heroin overdose.	Oh my god. That's absolutely devastating. I am so sorry. That's one the hardest drugs I've ever tried to get through, and it's one I've never tried before."
"I only met him a few times, but he touched a lot of people's lives.	That is terrible, I feel sorry for your friend, I hope he has a long life"
"An extremely timid girl in my physics class invited the class to see her band play at a bar downtown.	What kind of band was it?"
"I actually went last Friday night. Turns out she is an incredible guitarist - a real shredder!	What a strange turn of events. How did you feel when you saw her playing?"
"I am pretty sure everyone is scared of being trapped in an elevator, and I can confirm it's quite a shock.	Really, what makes you so sure?"
"Yes just a couple weeks ago. The elevator screeched to a halt and the lights went out, and I have to confess I screamed.	I would have screamed as well!  I can remember being scared out of my mind when I was trapped in an elevator.  What a crazy feeling!"
"I thank God every day for the many blessings. Especially our new home	Congratulations. Are you in a new home?"
"5 months ago now. It's really nice here, there are 3 swimming pools	That's great!  I wish I had a swimming pool!  You must be so happy!"
"Right after I had my baby, my husband worked second shift, so he didn't get home until around 2am.	Did you still have work?"
"Yeah, but it wasn't really a problem, until one night around 11pm. I was changing her diaper. The changing table was in front of a window, and I could hear people running up and down the porch in front of the window and they were banging on the house.	Oh wow! That's crazy!  Did it take long at all?"
"I'm not sure. Doors and windows were locked, but I was so relieved when my husband got home.	I'm a youth leader, and just the other day a teen from the group was asked to speak at a local church.	Did he get chosen to speak at that church?? That's awesome!"
"He was nervous, he has to prepare an original message. He did really good, and he really showed and understanding of the bible.	That sounds very interesting! What was his original message, and how was it received by the church?"
"Thank you.	I get so mad when I have to repeat myself	I know exactly what you mean!  It's the worst!  Do you ever remember the first time?"
"I know. But it makes me stressed out	What do you repeat?"
"Hello ... today I am happy, we go with my children to the movies and then to eat pizza	That sounds like fun! I love doing movies too. What kind of movie do they want to see most?"
"The incredible ... they love ... it's going to be fun	That sounds so great! I love pizza!"
"Thank you very much and you too..	Graduating from college was a load off my shoulders.	I can understand the stress, what are you going for"
"Thanks, it was a long journey.	What are you studying?"
"I was turned down for a job I really thought I'd be a good fit at.	Oh. Sorry to hear. I hope you find something soon."
"Someone else interviewed who had much more experience than I did.	I'm sorry. I know how hard it is to feel like that."
"I went to a sketchy part of town once. Just being there put me on edge.	Was it a scary sketchy part of town?"
"It was for work so I had to do it, but I typically avoid those places as well	Yeah I don't like sketchy areas either. What kind of job did you pick up?"
"We went to a friend's house the other day for dinner. I was helping her cook. I was following the directions of a recipe and accidentally cracked her baking dish.	Uh oh! Did she get upset with you for it or were you trying to be nice?  I hope it wasn't too hard to fix, it happens."
"Yes, I did, but she wouldn't even hear of it. She told me it was fine.	That's good that you followed the recipe and didn't get too irritated with her"
"I am looking forward to moving into a easy place to take care of.	That's a good thing. Are you moving for a new home?"
"No, not moving soon, only wanting to and looking around to see what is affordable.	That's so awesome!  I'm moving in with my sister next week!  affordable apartment?  yay"
"So I had an emergency come up for my family and I had enough money to cover it. I feel great for preparing!	That is good, were you worried you might not have enough?"
"Definitely! And they are paying me back, so it isn't like I'm losing money either.	They are definitely giving you back a little bit. That is wonderful."
"I drank a lot of alcohol at my friend's BBQ party, and I ended up puking and passing out. Not my finest moment.	Oh no! Sorry to hear! I've never been to an event like that so I'm not really judgey"
"Hahahaha! Well, I guess we can make light of even our worst moments.	Oh no, that's terrible. Did he take it the other way?"
"My eldest son just graduated High School I was so proud.	That's amazing! Congratulations! I know you must be very proud of him!"
"It's kind of a surreal feeling tho, hard to accept that he is grown.  Now college is about to start.	That is so exciting! You must be so happy for him!"
"The time just flys by doesn't it?  It hard to imagine that they dont need you so much anymore.	So a customer just came into my work and started yelling at me for something that wasn't my fault. I hate when people do that!	Customer service is so important. Did you say something to them?"
"No, I didn't yell back haha. I would get fired.	Customer service is so important. You must have a very good relationship with them if they would do that!"
"Retail, yep.	It makes me angry when people never notice me	Why is that? Do you always look through your mirror at the moment?"
"Everything. I don't have friends so it's nice to get noticed	I'm sorry you're so lonely.  Are you always lonely or do you have people around you a lot?"
"I get excited when I go swimming	Is it a pleasurable experience?"
"The fact of relaxing in a large pool of water. It just grabs my attention	i love doing that too. i can't swim though :("
"My wife wasn't feeling so well, so I took care of her and made her some soup <3	Good of you. I love soup."
"She is much better now! I love her so much, so I try to take good care of her.	Aww I love soup. That's so nice you guys took care of her!"
"I am so grateful to my family	Yes. No family can do that for you."
"They help me with whatever I need and they are always their for me.	I'm so grateful to my family They help me with whatever I need and they are always supportive!"
"I was surprised when my parents threw me a party	Oh that must have been awesome!"
"It really was. I am pretty thankful for them	That's nice that you have such a good parents! Was it your birthday or a party?"
"A big wind storm blew through town and uprooted one of the trees in my yard.	Oh no, that's awful. I hope no damage was done."
"No, but that was my fear. I kept waiting to hear the sound of a branch or tree hitting my roof, or breaking glass.	Oh wow. I guess it was really lucky for you to not die during that storm"
"I took my dog to an agility competition and she ended up winning first place!	Congrats! How big is she now? :)"
"Thanks so much! It did, but she's so hard-working and I couldn't have done it without her.	You're very welcome! I can't believe no one else would show her some love!"
"I was sad when my parents left me	Oh no. Why are they leaving?"
"I stay with my older sister now	That's awful. How did they leave you?"
"My brother got a really high-paying job and now spends all his time flaunting his money.	oh, flaunting is a good way of putting people in your shoes. I hope he really appreciates the good job and can quit his bad habit."
"Not very well! I mostly just stew and complain about it and wish I had his money and lifestyle.	I feel you.My brother is doing the same thing. He is 17 and has a good job, but he also seems to be getting more interested in female strippers. I don't think he is very well off yet."
"I was disgusted when my food had a hair in it	I hate when my food had a hair in it too!  What does that mean??  Did you put the food in a hair dryer??"
"Yeah I got a refund. They were very sorry about it and I forgave them	That is not cool.  What did they forgive you?"
"I was anxious when I went to the theme park	Did it make you ride a lot of rides? theme parks are always stressful for me as well."
"The roller coasters	They are really well made! Did you ride any?"
"I was furious when my friend made fun of me in front of random strangers.	I hate when friends make fun of me.  What did he say to you?"
"I am not sure. He told me he was sorry afterwards but I didn't listen to him	That is rude!"
"I feel so lonely because I have no friends	I'm sorry to hear you feel lonely.  I have the same feeling- I hardly have social media anymore :(  Do you have any outside friends?"
"I haven't. Im too shy and I am scared of what people will say	I understand, but don't feel scared, talk to people!"
"I was jealous when my girlfriend was talking to other guys	How come? Is everything okay?"
"I do not. I have trust issues	Well you should have no issues with that"
"I was terrified when I watched that horror film in the theaters	Horrible film! Why was it so scary!!"
"I did but it was really a challenge for me.	Horrible! I bet that was hard! What was the movie about?"
"I was sad when my dad died	I'm sorry to hear that. How did he pass?"
"It happened 3 weeks ago	I'm so sorry.  I've lost both of mine, so I know the feeling of losing someone.  What happened?"
"I was sad when my wife left me	why what happened?"
"I just dont know why she would marry me then.	She might just be an enabler."
"My family and I went to the beach on Tues and spent the whole day there.	Sounds lovely! Did you make any special gift?"
"One small thunderstorm but other than that great! I'm amazed I didn't really get burnt!	Sounds amazing! I love the sound of rain, especially when it's hot."
"When someone talks down to me, it makes me sad	I feel the exact opposite.  Its the exact opposite of what they would want to do"
"I am just too shy to say anything. I dont know how	I feel the same way. It's very rude and annoying."
"I am super joyful when my family comes together to eat dinner	That's so nice! How many people do you have?"
"Usually once a week. Its a great feeling	That is really nice to have. Do they enjoy eating together?"
"I was surprised when my parents threw me a big party	I bet you were happy! What were they doing to surprise you?"
"It was. I had a great time	Was it your first time?"
"I am so annoyed that people are so mean to other people	I know the feeling. I wish people didn't treat each other so so so poorly. Have you had a experience like this recently/"
"That is so true! I dont know where this world is heading.	Where is it headed? I can not afford all of my bills."
"I get so jealous when my parents don't pay me any attention.	Why is that"
"I haven't because I don't know how to start that conversation.	I am sorry you feel that way.  Try not to be jealous too much!"
"I was furious when my dog ate the wires to my Television	Was the television working?"
"Yeah but it will take a few days because I have to wait for my paycheck	Wow! Did it eat the wires? That would explain a lot, since those are the cheap parts, and they're the cheap wires, too! What do you plan on doing about it?"
"So what happens in the middle of the night? I got woken, again, by my upstairs neighbor thumping around. Does she have to be so rude?!	That would be annoying! Have you told her?"
"No, they don't. Well, this time I've had enough. I've told management I want into another apartment and explained exactly why!	Oh wow. Maybe she thought you were being rude. I would tell management too."
"Not really, but the alternative is to go slowly mad. These blessed individuals stomp around day and night, screeching into their cellphones - they're horrible.	I am a very trusting person. It gets me in trouble sometimes.	Why do people get in trouble?  Are they doing it for the wrong reasons?"
"People take advantage of me	I'm sorry, that must suck to have that happen sometimes."
"I'm only 6 months away from having my AA in Healthcare Administration.	That's awesome. I hope you enjoy your new job and have an awesome experience!"
"I really am, I can't wait to start my new career!	Congratulations! I am sure you are excited to begin your career too."
"Going to the dentist always has me on edge. I hate it!	I know.  I always dread going there"
"I know...it's a necessary evil. But it hurts so much!	It's definitely painful.  What's worse is when you have to wait in lines.  The dentist gives you one extra payment for being so close!"
"One of my very dear friends got his dream job recently. He was so diligent in finding information and contacts. I so respect what he's achieved.	That's great! Does he know what kind of job it is?"
"Well, it takes perseverance and a bit of luck, but you can do it!	Yeah, I can relate. It takes quite some luck, and I'm sure if you work hard at it, you can achieve it too!"
"Lol, you and me both. You could always marry a Kardashian!	hahahaha good one!"
"Or someone not quite so objectionable :) Seriously though, I'm so happy for K with his new job.	We started watching a Red Sox game near the end and they were losing. Next thing you know, they were ahead four runs.	That's baseball! That is exciting!"
"Yes, usually I think so too. But this was really fun to watch and we were so happy because it did not look good at first.	That is very exciting! I am glad you had fun watching it!"
"My car that I hate is going to die soon and I'll be able to get a new one. Score!	Nice, what year?"
"I'm thinking something reliable. Maybe a toyota or mazda.	Those seem like good choices. You're very lucky"
"Yesterday my husband opened a window and a HUGE black bug flew in!! I almost died!!	I would have died too!"
"heck no, i told my husband to deal with it. i ran in my bedroom and locked the door	That is terrifying. I am glad he closed it"
"Well, don't you know, one of my neighbors who works for AA was in San Francisco recently and saw some Scottish cheese (I'm Scottish). So she bought some and brought it to me. How nice of her to do that!	That's awesome, what type of cheesecake was it"
"This particular one was a cheddar and it tends to be from smaller producers and is creamier and more flavorful than the cheeses we typically get here.	That's a shame. Scottish cheeses are typically expensive so that had to be a pain to get a hold of."
"Ooh, I haven't tried Cabot. Must look out for it. The cheddar I normally get is from Tillamook. I think it's from Oregon. Where's Cabot from?	Interesting! I have no idea where either of those places comes from. I will definitely be on the lookout!"
"I've never done that. Wonder if there's a cheese factory near me. I'm in NC, where the people almost all seem as nice as my kind neighbor!	People are so much more open and helpful here than in other places I have lived. Mustangs are so easy to steal from, too! I'm surprised cabott isn't more popular"
"my brother would've turned 34 today. he died 2 years ago and It still hurts so much	Oh man. Sorry to hear that. Was he in an accident or was he in the course of his life when he died. Either way it still sucks."
"yes we were. He moved to the different country but we spoke pretty often	Oh man. Sorry to hear about that."
"I had planned to go to the beach with friends, but it looks like it's going to rain.	time for Plan B"
"Nah, it said there's be thunder and lightning, so looks like we're stuck inside :(	Lightening is the worst... atleast its not going to rain"
"I spent last weekend with most of my family, they live out of state and i don't see them often.	did you enjoy it?"
"I did, Yes. Work has been hectic lately so i was really looking forward to unwinding with them.	That's cool. It can really kick your butt when you have time to spend time with them after a long week of work."
"We ate good food, drank wine and went swimming.	I bet that was fun! What did you do after you unwinded?"
"It was, kind of hot but not enough to complain about.	That sounds great! I love swimming! Did you have to get up really early for it? I hope it didn't get to hot to swim in!"
"I hate how our country is so divided right now	How so"
"True. I hope we can become less divided in the future and solve things	I do not like how our country is divided either. I hope things get better for you, too."
"My father passed away about 2 years ago. It was so very difficult for me and very unexpected. We didn't know he had a life-threatening illness and weren't prepared in any way for his sudden departure from us.	Sorry for the delay but I have a very similar situation in my life and it's really rough too. Just got back to work and it's so very tough still."
"Yes, my family and I are close and we were there for each other. But, my sister had passed away around 6 years before, by committed suicide. The last few years have been very difficult.	sorry to hear that, thats very sad"
"I feel like a terrible sibling right now.	Why do you think that? Is there something in the water?"
"My sister, who lives out of state and i don't see often, was recently in town visiting our dad. I didn't visit with them.	Oh that is sad. Do they visit you often at least?"
"I am going to a concert very soon.	That sounds fun, what band?"
"Imagine Dragon and Grace Vanderwhall, do you know them?	No, I don't. Who are they?"
"Yes she was.	Our new property management person is remarkably efficient. She emailed me details of a conversation we had yesterday. The others promise the earth and don't deliver!	That's good, it can sometimes be a lot to handle"
"It is. I've been trying to switch apartments for months and this is the first time someone has actually done anything about it.	I would be a mess. I'd switch again"
"Absolutely! I move September 1st. No more stompy screechy neighbors at 3 am!!	School for my kids started again this past Thursday.	Oh wow! Did you make any changes for school yearbooks?"
"It was good. I am dealing with a mixture of both emotions about them being back in school. I was happy I had all the supplies, clothes, shoes, and other odds and ends in time.	I imagine it is a lot to prepare for, do they enjoy the class?"
"I had planned a beach trip about a month before we actually went.	Was it a good idea at least? I've always wanted to go to Outer Banks National Park!"
"We went to Virginia Beach earlier this week. I was so giddy up that whole month I could barely contain myself.	Did it turn out to be worth the trip?"
"My husband, 2 kids and my mother. My kids had never been to the beach.	I've only been to one and it sucked! I'm sure you are happy about it."
"I bought a ticket last week for the lottery, when it was over 100 million dollars.	Wow! How much did you pay for?"
"I was so excited watching the numbers being drawn, but no I didn't win. But someone did! I'm sure they were happy.	That's really awesome. How much is the prize?"
"True, but it would be fun spending that money.	My husband just found out he will start getting a monthly bonus! This was unexpected and great news	That is really good for him!"
"It sure does. It came as a shock, but a pleasant one.	That's awesome! How much is it and where does he go to get it?"
"I just went today to visit my son in his new house.	How was that?"
"It was great! He has saved for so long to buy it.	That's awesome. It's always good when a parent can just go buy a ""good"" house and not have to ask for help from anyone else!"
"So tonight we are suppose to go eat out as a family but I cant get a single one of my family members to agree on a place.  So frustrating!	That's the worst! Have they been wanting to eat together?"
"That's actually not a bad idea.  Wish I had come up with that earlier.  It seems everyone wants something different.	Everyone likes what they like right? If they won't agree then that's their loss and you can go ahead and do it that way, it's not a big deal!"
"Im going to have to sue that for next week.  I think this week they can all go make PB&J since they want to be difficult.	You might be on to something there.  You might be saving a lot of money too"
"I guess that way the wallet wins every once and awhile too!  lol	I'm so happy that it is Friday!	Me too! Do you have any plans for Friday?"
"Somewhat, I work 4 10 hour shifts and have a random off day during the week. Yesterday was my off day. What about you?	I have one day off this week and then I have two days off this month! I love those offs."
"feels disappointed because my friend fights with me	That sucks. Have you asked to fight against your friend?"
"no i can't because i love him a lot	That sucks. Have they talked to you about it?"
"I have Lupus and it is getting worse.  I asked my doctor for a chance to try a new diet I found that is suppose to help me with it.	Oh that's terrible! I hope your doctor was able to give you some treatment options."
"yes, but they are quite powerful which I am trying to avoid.  I am already on one and I am hoping that through this diet I can get off b/c the next steps won't be fun	I am sorry to hear that! I hope the diet works for you!"
"Some time ago, there was a terrible tornado that came through my city. It destroyed many homes, a school and some people died. I was so fearful and petrified it would come by our home and destroy it, or harm my familY!	Wow, I can't even imagine how awful it must have felt. I'm glad you're safe though. Do people there live in your neighborhood?"
"No, they are so awful! They can destroy so much.	Tornadoes are one of my worst fears!  Are you ok?"
"My husband took me to get a new wedding band recently	How nice! Have you been looking forward to it for a while? Did he pick out some cool ones?"
"I didn't know ahead of time! Mine had broken a bit and he saved up to get me a new one.	That's awesome! Did he get you one when it broke? That is awesome!"
"I love the holidays. Driving around looking at decoration is my favorite.	Me too! What is ornamentation like?"
"Christmas. It makes me miss my moms decor.	I'm guessing she isn't coming back to town this year?"
"I have a wonderful sister-in-law.  who is always there for me when I need her	That's really sweet of her!  What makes her so special?"
"I feel so lucky to have her as a sister-in-law and a friend.  She is always there to offer a supporting ear and encouraging word.	That's great. It's nice that you have someone like that."
"A few weeks ago, we finally got a chance to get back to the beach for our vacation. But, it rained several days, so we didn't get to spend as much time at the beach as we wanted, which sucked. We were really looking forward to it.	that stinks, i hope we can get another chance soon!"
"Oh, no, it was about a 7 hour drive! My daughter was quite young when we went and didn't remember the first trip and she's a teenager now. So, a long time since we first went.	Was the drive fun at least? How old is your daughter now?"
"My husband just a promotion at work he was really wanting	That is great! He has to make do with what he has."
"I know..ha ha!  He worked so hard for this and I am so proud of him.	That is great news. He must have really worked hard."
"We took a vacation recently and had to leave my daughter's teenage boyfriend a key to our house so he could take care of the pets. He's a good young man, so we didn't feel uncomfortable anything would come up missing.	Thats good,kids can grow up to so many emotions"
"We didn't have much choice, as we had an outdoor dog and indoor cat, so if we didn't, we'd come back to not having pets. But, I wouldn't just let anybody, that's for sure!	That's fair, being with a good child should make you very happy and content!"
"My mother-in-law once told a secret of mine that she promised she would never tell	Oh my! What was the secret?"
"I know it really hurt me and I had to work on trusting her again with other things	Is there a way out of it?"
"One night when my children and I came home, I saw a shadow inside! I was so fearful and afraid!	I do not believe you"
"It was so scary! Luckily, it was actually my shadow! The light made my shadow show up, but it first appeared to be an intruder!	Oh my gosh that's hilarious! I would be terrified! What did the intruder do after he left?"
"Last weekend, my family and I enjoyed a nice meal together, and then watched a movie. It was a relaxing time at home, just enjoying each other's company.	That sounds nice"
"Yes, it was drama free and a relaxing time.	That's really nice. You guys sound very happy."
"My dog, riley had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure	oh no. that's horrible. what breed?"
"It was one of the hardest things I had to go through but I know that Riley is not suffering anymore so that helps	I'm so sorry to hear that. That's so heart breaking and I wish you all of our best"
"I didn't tell my friend when her boyfriend hit on me. She was in a bad spot and needed him for financial support, and that's why I didn't tell her. But, I still felt so bad about it.	Sometimes we do things for a reason. I guess I'm one of those people."
"Well, she had custody of her handicapped grandchild and no job, plus she was very much in love with him. I thought it would just make things worse for her.	Sometimes, in situations of emotional distress, it makes the situation worse. It's hard for us to see our friends getting in a bad spot when we haven't seen them in awhile and we haven't seen them for a long time, especially if they're close like parents. It's hard to see a loss like that"
"I am trying a new diet to treat my Lupus.	That's terrible! Have you tried any diet apps?"
"I am nervous b/c so much rides on if this works or not.  If it doesn't than I have to take some really powerful meds that i would rather not take	I'm sorry you have to go through all that! I hope the doctors say it works out for you!"
"There's a coworker that will not follow instructions on work assignments, so she makes many mistakes. It's so frustrating and aggravating, since it causes others more work.	That's frustrating. What kind of mistakes does she sometimes make? I can't think of any that I've seen."
"Exactly! You try nicely to explain it to her over and over, but she won't listen. Such a nuisance!	That's frustrating. Maybe you should tell the department head?"
"My mother picked my daughter up for school to take in the morning, and found her cat dead. It was so hard for my daughter and made us all very upset.	That cat was probably sick. How old was the cat, 17? 18? 19? 20?"
"Yes, she was only about 9, and loved her cat so much. It broke my heart to see her so upset!	Aww.. I am sorry. Losing a pet is never easy. It is great that you have someone to help in that difficult situation!"
"I decided to play the lottery the other day and won.	How much did you pay for the tickets?"
"Not normally, so I was quite surprised.	Wow. How much did you pay for the ticket?"
"$1000. It was enough to help me catch up on my bills. So I was happy.	Wow, what are you going to spend it on?"
"Thank you, that was the first time I have ever won anything like that. I almost passed out.	I have a bad experience at the supermarket the other day.	Oh really? What made you have such bad experience"
"Someone backed into my new car.	Oh no! How did that make you feel?"
"Yes, they ran! I was so mad when I got to the car and saw it.	Many years ago, we were at a friend's house and one of her friend's was there and she was drunk. My husband was very insistent on helping her, but I felt he was being a bit to 'helpful'. It made me a bit angry!	Helpfulness doesn't always come to mind in marriage, but it should always be available if someone needs it!"
"Well, she was attractive and at the time, I thought he was thinking that too. But, I know now he was just trying to help her get to a safe place, since she was falling down. But, it was hard to see it at that time lol	It's funny you mention your husband. I'm a very trusting person, so I totally understand your feelings. My mom was in the hospital for quite a few days after her husband had an alcoholocaust (not a peephole). I had a hard time trusting people after that, too, since I've always been"
"I had a bad morning when I went to check my mail.	Check your mail? what was in there?"
"Especially when you find your mailbox laying in about 10 pieces after someone knocked it down last night.	Did this morning brighten your day?"
"Not really. I live in town, but it's a small town.	Oh no! Do they not deliver in town?"
"That's a good idea. I might do that. We don't have a camera because we don't normally have any troubles.	That's good you have a backup plan if something happens."
"My aunt came to visit today, we went out for mexican food!	Oh that sounds awesome!  What did you all eat and how much Mexican did you eat!"
"Yes, kind of upset she was only able to stay in town for a few hours, she is on a road trip!	Aww that sucks! Hopefully she'll come home to visit you guys soon."
"I have a big exam for college coming up, I have been studying day and night.	Well I think you are going to do a great job on it!"
"It is for my molecular biology class, I feel pretty good that I am going to Ace it.	That's awesome! I hope you're able to. When I took the LSATs for high school, they were really hard so I'm sure you'll do just fine."
"I went and saw a hockey game today, It was really exciting.	That's pretty cool.  Was it a pretty close game, if I may ask?  Was it close?"
"No, I use to play growing up. I haven't been to a game since graduating highschool.	Aw, that's too bad. Perhaps you could find yourself a new sport?"
"I was on a run today, and saw a loose dog but couldn't catch it before it ran off!	That is so sad!  Where was it?"
"Maybe if you live in Central Texas...haha! But I was so worried about that small dog getting hit!	Central Texas here, can confirm that it's a desolate hell haha! What breed was the dog?"
"I got some bad news today, my dad passed away.	Sorry to hear that, my friend"
"Thank you, I am a mess. It is still hasn't hit me that he passed away.	Oh my god, I'm so sorry! I've lost both my grandparents within the past 5 years. I can't even imagine how you must be feeling right now."
"Its so quiet in my house, my husband is out of town for work.	Aww that's a bummer! Maybe find yourself some quiet quiet time by yourself?"
"True, I'm trying but keep hearing creepy noises. Guess I need to turn the TV up louder haha	Hahaha maybe you should hide the tv in your bathroom!"
"I got some great news today! My husband got a better paying job offer!	Oh that's awesome! What does he do?"
"Not sure yet, but itll help us life more comforatbly! We move to his hometown in November when he gets out of Army!	Congrats!  That sounds awesome!  I hope he's happy!"
"My daughter is in highschool but took a college course this summer and got an A!	Oh wow!  Congratulations! That is awesome!  What is her major."
"That is very good. You should be proud of her.	I ate way too many sweets today!	Aw, too many? You okay? We're supposed to like sweets."
"Thanks! Being on a diet is hard, espically with family in town!	That's never fun. Are you feeling better now, at least?"
"I was running today and felt like this car was following me..	What kind of car was it and how fast did you think you was going?"
"Yes it was, I think I need to start carrying pepper spray or something	did anything happen to you?"
"Im watching the show The Bold Type, my favourtie characters dad died :(	Oh that's so sad! I can't imagine what you're feeling right now. I hate losing a loved one."
"Yes, it's a great girly drama! Reminds me of Sex in the City but Modern.	Wow! That's terrible, I can relate to- although I think it's more tragic. I don't really like tragic shows though."
"It's been a great night! I'm just relaxing with a cold drink and my favourite show!	whats your favorite show"
"Yes defenitly, It dosen't get better then this! My daughter has been fast asleep since 8pm.	That's pretty slow, sleep is my least favorite thing to spend my day doing"
"My family is moving from Texas to Arkansas in a few months, Im worried for the change.	why are they leaving?"
"My husband is getting out of the Army and moving back to his hometown where he has a few job offers! Big changes coming..	That is scary!  I'm sure the changes are scary for you as well, but I hope it works out for you.  What do you think you'll be doing there?"
"I recently moved into a new home.	That's great! How's it been?"
"Yes, there are a lot of kids that our daughter can play with.	That's awesome! My daughter is only 6 so it's hard to have kids haha"
"We had been saving for 4 years to buy a bigger house. We had outgrown our other home.	I had a doctors appointment today.	Oh, did it make you feel good to get looked over by one?"
"I was so mad because I had to wait a hour after my appointment time before they called me back.	Oh no! I hate when that happens!"
"I agree! Everyone was so annoyed because we were all waiting forever.	I had just moved in to my new apartment, and every night this skinny little tabby came begging for food at my door.	That sounds like a cute cat, what is it called?"
"At first I tried to resist, but I ended up adopting him!	That sounds so sweet!"
"I received a wrong number call last night at 2 in the morning.	Was it a long con?  Did everything work out finally."
"Yes! It was so aggravating. They would not believe me when I kept telling them it was the wrong number.	That would make my night, so many people lose it their night!"
"She did twice before she finally believe me that there was no Bret there.	I recently found out that I am having baby number 4.	Oh cool!  How far in advance do you have to have the appointment?"
"Wow! That is great. We were thrilled because we didn't know if we were going to have anymore and nature just decided for us.	Wow, that's amazing! I'm happy to hear about this, and what an amazing life that makes us!"
"Yes they are. They make life worth living.	Halloween is quite a big holiday where I live. People get really in to their costumes!	I live in the UK. Halloween is our national holiday. I've seen so many people dressing asolph HHH and HWHoH"
"It's peoples creativity that makes it so entertaining. Last year I went as a plague doctor, and everyone agreed it was terrifying!	I've always wanted to go as a plague doctor!"
"Last year we lost our home of 20 years to a house fire.	Sorry to hear that, did the fire start in your area?"
"Yes, thankfully everybody was safe. Nobody was even home when it happened.	That's so sad. Did insurance cover it?"
"No, we just bought another house closer to town. It was sad losing everything that we had.	When me and my friend got lost in the desert, I thought we were done for.	oh my god, why did you get lost?"
"Only a couple of hours. We flagged down an old Chevy truck and the man driving got us sorted out.	Oh wow. That is a miracle haha"
"I went tonight to meet my daughters teacher.	I hope it went well for you!"
"Yes, I think she will be a great teacher. She showed us her plan for the year and I think it was great.	What was the plan?"
"Thanks so much. I completely agree.	I just finished watching the Saw movie.	That's awesome! I love that movie!!"
"I hated it! I didn't want to watch it but my husband did. The gore is just too much!	I hate gory movies, too. What was it you didn't like?"
"Yep! I feel kind of sick to my stomach now from watching it.	I recently went down memory lane was looked at all my high school yearbooks.	How did that make you feel?"
"Well.... maybe not as awesome. lol But I do try to keep in shape. It was good seeing all my old friends.	Those high school years can be really interesting, if you were around them a lot."
"I do a lot of them but some have moved away and we just lost touch.	I'm sure it stinks for you but I'm sure there are plenty more fish in the sea."
"That's a good idea!	That's a relief. Maybe you can still keep in touch online?"
"I had this guy flag me down today after leaving the store.	That's very polite. I would do the same. How did they get so mad?"
"I was scared at first and then he hollered and pointed to the top of my car and I had left my purse on it. Boy, did my face get red.	LOL! I would have been so mad. Did he at least apologize?"
"My daughter just bought her first car on her own.	Wow, she must really be getting into the car buying lifestyle!"
"It's a 2008 Mustang. She worked the last two summers to buy it.	Mustang are awesom, my parents have one as well!"
"She is super excited to start school now and show it off.	I'm leaving tomorrow to go on vacation!	Where are you going"
"We are going to Daytona and Orlando for 10 days.	I love vacation time. I went to Panama City Beach for like two weeks when I was kid."
"I sure hope so! We've been planning this trip for a year.	Thats sounds awesome, are you going alone or with friends?"
"My husband and I have a fun weekend trip planned soon. We are going to go to the casino for the weekend, just the two of us. We are really looking forward to it.	That sounds like sooo much fun! Which casino?"
"Yes, it's been awhile since we had just some time for us. Plus, we love Blackjack!	That sounds like so much fun. You are making me want to get out and start playing."
"I have a very good friend and her live-in boyfriend of 5 years hit on me! I'm married, and he didn't care. He sickens me!	That is a slap to the face."
"Yes, I was really surprised and I find it terrible behavior.	That's very shocking and I would definitely report it to the police!"
"We went on a vacation a few weeks ago, and it really made me think back to our last vacation. It was with my father, the last one before he passed away.	I am so sorry to hear about your loss. Where did you guys last vacation together/"
"I did, but of course, wished I had more time. He passed away unexpectedly, so I was going over that vacation in my mind too. I miss him.	I'm sorry about that. Where did you all go?"
"I was pleasantly shocked the other day when I won on a lottery ticket! I hardly ever win and I won $200!	That's awesome. How often do you play?"
"I just tucked it back for a rainy day. But, I may splurge with it this weekend, since it was unexpected.	Congratulation!  I know that is one the most satisfying moments when you win a little extra money.  I once won 20$ in a candy contest."
"My husband sure did surprise me with his handiness and hard work around the house last week. He was able to accomplish so much work in a few days!	That's wonderful! I am glad to hear that!"
"Ok	I was the first person to receive a pretigious award at my college after years of the award being on offer.	Wow! I bet that meant a lot to you!"
"At the department office back at the school.	That's cool! Did it make you proud"
"One of my coworkers really ticked me off one day. She decided she would delegate some work to me by slamming on my desk and demanding I do it. She had some nerve!	that is mean"
"Yes, she doesn't have the right to do that. I have been that many years longer than her, and it was her work! I let her know it too.	that sounds really rude"
"One year my cousin wasn't going to get her young son anything for Christmas. It broke my heart so my husband and I bought his Santa gifts that year.	That is so thoughtful.  I'm so sorry that happened.  Did he appreciate it?  It's such a thoughtful holiday gift."
"The little guy deserved a Christmas and we really loved him.	That's so sad, it's so hard to feel that way toward your cousin. What gifts did you end up getting her?"
"When I went to the fair last year, I tripped on a large cord they had going across the walkway. It was a long, running fall! I wanted to hide!	Oh no, that sounds painful! I hope no one saw you fall!"
"Scuffed knees, but mainly my pride. I was also in front an attractive guy I knew so it was even worse.	I would have been embarrassed as heck!  Did they at least throw you off balance on purpose?"
"My husband and I are at a point in our lives, we are able to save, afford all that we need and save for retirement. I'm so appreciate we can, as I know many aren't able to do that.	It's nice to hear that. I am glad you have that opportunity."
"Yes, we have been working hard, as well as not always getting all the extras we would like at times. But, it's worth having some financial freedom!	It's so nice to have the financial stability of our lives.  I have been lucky to be in that position.  It feels like we have been struggling for so long."
"One day at work while I was pregnant, I fell! Luckily, the baby and I weren't hurt, but I wanted to waddle away so fast!	Oh my! I bet that must have been so scary!"
"Yes, it really was quite so!	Oh no! That's scary! I'm glad you weren't hurt though!"
"There are times I feel a bit alone and down. My husband has to travel out of town for work quite often.	I know that can be really tough especially if you are not near family! But being lonely can also serve to fuel your imagination more so than to provide any useful information."
"Well, yes, of course. But, that isn't quite the same, is it.	I understand that. traveling can make it hard. But it is needed to meet new people. I am glad you find peace!"
"My children recently started school again and it made me feel a bit apprehensive. They are growing up so quick, and I know it won't be long before they sadly move out of the house :(	I understand. I had the same feeling when my youngest left the nest."
"For sure! But, it flies by before you know it. I get my nerves on edge when I think about them all moved out of the house.	Yeah kids really like to move out of their parents houses.. I had 2 girls move out of their parents houses.. It was a huge problem!"
"Despite working until a few hours before, I scored highly on the ACT the first time I took it back in high school years ago.	That's awesome! Did you get a good score?"
"Thanks. I thought I'd do poorly because I was tired.	Congradulations. You must be quite proud of your score."
"Not that long ago, my husband planned a secret trip for us! I didn't have a clue he was doing it and was pleasantly shocked. It was so much fun!	Where did he go? Did he surprise you?"
"We just took a weekend trip to Tunica, MS. We stayed at a really nice casino hotel and just played some Blackjack, enjoyed good food and each other's company!	That's amazing! Did you guys have a lot of fun playing Blackjack?"
"I lied to my mother one day about where I was going. It made me feel pretty bad and have a bad conscience.	Where did you lie about it?  Was it at least a honest mistake?"
"She didn't want me going with that friend, but I wanted to go, so I lied to her. I was much younger then.	Did you guys ever grow out of that?"
"I won a free trip to Florida. It's not the best vacation, but I'll take it for free.	You must be excited and full of anticipation. How far away are you planning on driving?"
"I've been to Florida many times before so it wears on you.	What is the deal with the free vacation? Do they give you anything extra for winning?"
"I won a lottery for a small amount of money.	How much was it, and how big is the jackpot?"
"No, I wish. It was only a few hundred dollars.	Small potatoes, what will you do with the extra money?"
"A good friend of mine moved away recently and we lost contact. I really wish we would still speak.	That is hard. I am sorry to hear that and I hope you feel better soon!"
"That's a good idea. Maybe I'll try that soon.	I know what you mean. That is tough. I recently lost contact also. Just hang out in the chat room and things will happen."
"Someone was speeding on the road and I got into an accident with them. My car was totalled because of their carelessness.	I am sorry to hear that."
"Yes, but not as much as the car was worth and it wasn't an enjoyable situation.	I understand, I'm so sorry to hear that!"
"I let a friend watch my dog for a week while I was out of town. I would've been devastated if anything happened to him.	Did he do anythng interesting?"
"I hope so. I've only had my dog for a short time and this is my first time away from him.	Oh no, I hope nothing bad happened to him! My thoughts are with you, I hope he is okay!"
"I have been feeling great about life recently. My relationships have been going very well	that's good to hear! How are your relationships?"
"I am not, but I have a person I am very fond of. Are you?	I am in a relationship right now, but I don't feel that way most of the time. You?"
"I got a surprise gift in the mail yesterday.	Oh really? What was it"
"A gorgeous vase. It's so pretty. I have no idea who sent it.	Who sent it to you?"
"Yes, I love flowers. I can't wait to fill it up.	My sister broke my vase. I was pretty enraged!	That's not cool! Why did she do that?"
"I scolded her but then told her it was okay, but it's not the biggest deal!	Scolding her for the vase? Scolding her for what?"
"I'm am upset today because my daughter who lives really far away called and said her baby was admitted to the hospital.	Aw, that's too bad. Is she upset because the baby wasn't expected?"
"He was premature so he's been having some breathing issues. I hate not being there.	Oh no that's awful. I hope everything works out for the best"
"I'm so taken by the talents of contestants on the show Face Off -- have you ever seen it?	I have not. Is it good or not really that great?"
"Their abilities to both imagine and create their characters is incredible!	I haven't actually but I will now. Sounds like quite the talents!  I watched the first season a loooong time ago."
"A lot people know Toys-R-Us has completely shut down not long ago.	What is that? I'm not too familiar with it."
"Yeah, a lot of my friends and I got to thinking of all our memories there. Really makes you think back.	Oh yeah. They're pretty sad. Did you have any toys there when you were a kid?"
"I feel so bad, I forgot my sisters birthday...	Was it a special occasion?"
"Yes I plan on it, its just been stressful time at home with a toddler, it slipped my mind	Was it out of the ordinary?"
"I love my husband so much I could never cheat on him.	That's wonderful that you have such a great relationship! It sounds like it's very personal."
"Yea, I wouldnt want to hurt him, i cant understand anyone who does.	That's really sweet. How long have you been together?"
"It can be really tough when your husband and teenagers have electronics.	I understand. I have experienced the same issues. How does the husband cope with it?"
"I do for family time but sometimes I can sit in a full room and still feel no one is there	Teenagers are so irresponsible. How often do you sit?"
"Tomorrow is my husbands Birthday!	Oh that's nice! Do you and him have a good time beforehand?"
"Yes, we are going out for a nice dinner. We haven't been on a date in months!	Well, that's lovely. I'm sure that'll be fun"
"I love the holidays, that make think back to being a kid.	Yes, I love the cold, the jolly ranchers, the singing karats, and the pumpkin patch. Why do you love the holidays so much, kiddos."
"Yea, that would really be great. Or maybe we'd get bored.	I agree, I love the holiday. It is so full of imagination and feeling good."
"There is a big storm going on in my town right now!	sounds super scary!"
"I don't, it makes me nervous with the strong winds and rain!	Oh I bet. Is everyone you care about okay?"
"My favorite game has an expansion on Monday, I can't wait.	What game is it"
"World of Warcraft, It's been my favorite for years.	Expansion packs are always a welcome surprise! What's the expansion?"
"I just got a promotion at my job!	Congrats! You deserved it!"
"I work in Human Resources for a big company, I wasn't expecting the promotion! Feel Blessed :)	Congrats! You deserved it :)"
"I really like every shelf in my house to be arranged just so.	That's a good idea! I would love for everything in my house to be like that!"
"I do, everything is in it's place. It thoroughly bothers me when someone puts random stuff on them, like cups or papers.	That's annoying too. It really puts me off, like putting pictures of my cat in the fridge."
"I just found out my husband is cheating on me..	I'm so sorry to hear that. Will there be other arrangements available to help?"
"A few months, I'm not sure what my next move is. Staying in a hotel for a few days to think.	Oh my god, that's terrible! Are you okay? I'm so sorry!"
"My daughter is finally fully potty trained!	Awesome! That is a big accomplishment!"
"Yes, I am very happy as well! No more buying diapers haha	Dang, that's impressive! How old is she?"
"So, my new puppy is adorable though maybe not as amazing yet as yours.	Haha, what breed? That's cute! What kind of puppy is it?"
"She's so cute and fun, i love her already.	Haha, well, we all get a little excited about getting a new puppy :) What kind of puppy did she?"
"I started doing more research on salaries for the degree I'll have in 6 months.	How have you found that so far"
"It seems to be about 60,000 per year just out of college. I am eager to see if the statistics are correct.	I hope it works out for you!"
"I know it's silly, but my friend got something I wanted in a game the other day, bit sad.	I'm sorry to hear about that, but what game was the game you were wanting?"
"I guess, little things at times right?	I know how that is. Sometimes things come back to bite us."
"I watched The Lion King today with my daughter, reminded me of my childhood.	it was so nice. my family went to see it with my nieces"
"Yes! I'm excited for that as well. I watched the movie with my mom when it first came out!	Oh that must have brought back some great memories! I remember watching it with my mom too!"
"5	4"
"Opps. Ok, i mean that I was sad the other day because a friend is moving.	That is hard. Were you friends before?"
"not to far, but it's still sad to see her go.	That's sad. How far are you guys moving?"
"I have been having a rough week!	Are things stressful?"
"Yes but I am afraid I might loose my job..	Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that! I know that can be a scary thought. I lost my job a few years back, only to upgrade to something more secure once I had recovered."
"I hate how our country is right now.	Why do you hate the current president?"
"People just can't seem to get along, makes me sad.	I know right? Things used to get so better.  Especially during the Obama years!"
"I spent all weekend alone, wish my family lived closer.	That must have stung a lot, being alone for so long. Do you have friends to go with?"
"My family is over 2,000 miles away in Alaska, its tough!	Oh wow!  Maybe you could take a trip and go visit them?"
"My husband woke up with his face swollen and a terrible toothache	Oh no. Did he have to go to the tooth doctor?"
"Not yet, but I was his bedside nurse all day. Anything he needed I was sure to get.	Sounds rough. Hopefully he will pull through and it will go away."
"Ah, it's been rough. My dog passed away two nights ago.	I'm so sorry. How old was he?"
"Thank you, she was 12 years old so I knew it was coming but still shook up about it.	Im so sorry for your loss! Losing a pet is always so hard"
"I hate when it storms so bad the power goes out	Oh that's the worst. I remember when that storm closed my town down, we got power almost immediately!"
"I agree.	yes i hate it as well, that is why i always have the old generator on when it storms!"
"I found a hundred dollar bill when cleaning my closet!	That is so lucky! How did you spend it?"
"No! I'm not sure where it came from! and I live alone :O	Wow! Did you try to find out where it came from?"
"There was a huge spider on my wall, it ran away before I could kill it..	Wow! Did you kill it? I would be ticked!"
"Me too, I think it was a wolf spider. I hope I can sleep tonight	That's terrible, i would cry if i saw that!"
"I'm so nervous, have a final exam on Tuesday!	I know that is so nerve wracking! I hope that it goes well!"
"Yes, I have been studying a lot but still worried. I need to get a good grade!	I am sure you will do well!"
"I have to give a speech on Thursday.	I hope you have prepared a lot for it! Are you nervous?"
"Yes. But mentally I am never ready to give a speech if im being honest.	I'm sorry to hear it's so tough for you. Are you worried? Maybe try reading a book or maybe practicing in front of a mirror."
"It's on local politics. Not a fun subject either!	I sold some stuff I didnt need last week.	Why did you sell stuff you didn't need last week???"
"Yea, enought to have great weekened anyway.	That is really good, did you buy low and sell high?"
"I think that my husband and me have so much faith in each other.	And what do you all think of that? faith is a key tenant when it comes to love"
"I know, I cant do that. I think it's very important to be honest in your love life.	I agree with that. It's important that both of you know that you love the person you are taking them to, and are loyal to them no matter what."
"Ten years ago now, a massive hurricane forced my family to evacuate. I didn't know if there would be anything to come back to.	Wow, that must've been terrifying"
"Pretty messed up, but the house was still standing.	Wow, what a terrible thing for you to have to go through! Was your house okay, did you have any damage?"
"was travelling 14 hours internationally. First flight got delayed and the airline would not apologize and provide altenative	That is very annoying, did they gave you a refund at least?"
"British airways. they claimed because they dont have ties to the connecting, they could not	That's awful! Where did you fly? And I'm so sorry that you had to endure that!"
"I've felt excited when I found out I had won a place on a prestigious creative writing course, taught by someone who I knew could help me in ways that I would I not be able to through self-study alone.	That's awesome! Congratulations! How long had it been since you had won?"
"Thank you for the kind words. You know what? It was, but not for the reasons I imagined! It turned out that everyone in the class developed a really close bond and while the advice from the teacher was wonderful, it was the lifelong friendships and mutual edits that the students do for each other that has proved equally special!	You know what's up! That sounds amazing and exciting! You're very lucky to have teachers like that."
"I think it was :)	I like going fishing, it reminds me of when I would go with my dad when I was a kid.	I do too! I used to love going, fishing or hiking."
"I do, I have a 6 month old boy. How about you?	i enjoy gardening too. i grew up fishing so much growing up. what about you?"
"I dropped all my food in the cafeteria the other day. Everybody was staring at me.	I would have been disgusted! What did you do?"
"No, it was at work.	Oh no! I would have been so embarrassed."
"I once accidently ran down the battery on my car when I mid-judged how long I could run the radio for without the engine running. It was 5am and I was in the middle of nowhere. I called the first person I could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery. I felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act. I was also embarrassed that I had let that happen and I learned from it!	I can just imagine you running the emergency lights and everything. Glad you came through it alright!"
"Yeah for sure! It was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car's battery power without engine running - so you make sure it won't happen again!	Oh no. That sounds like a big accident! I'm glad you learned from it."
"I'm ready for college football to start. I can't wait for kickoff weekend!	I can't wait for it to be over with and for the tailgating to continue!"
"Auburn Tigers	Roll Tide!"
"I did something really foolish at the grocery store yesterday.	What did you do?"
"I was reaching for some pasta sauce and knocked a few of them over. They shattered on the ground a such a huge mess that two workers had to come mop it up.	Oh no! I hate when that happens...especially when you are trying to pay"
"I can't believe he did it! I just went to my brother's graduation ceremony at Princeton.	What happened??"
"Oh yeah, definitely! He put in a ton of work and it all paid off!	Wow, I bet that was exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time, huh. Well, you're welcome."
"I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags. It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn't disappoint, he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!	I love when strangers help each other out. I'm glad you were able to make it all work out without any drama. :)"
"It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier.	That's cool, it was a cool night."
"I was really mad when I walked out my door the other day to go to work and my neighbors big dog jumped up on me and knocked me over.	That would make me mad too! Big dogs can be so annoying sometimes."
"Yes, I hurt my back and couldn't even go to work. Shouldn't the dog be on a leash. Ugh!	LOL! Well in my neighborhood we don't have time for all that!"
"My transmission in my car went out the other day, maybe it won't be too expensive to repair.	That would be nice.  Is that something that can be done easily?"
"Yes they are. I had just put a down payment on a house too, so my money is tied up.	What will cost more, the house or the transmission?"
"I am fuming. I saw someone key my car while I was at the grocery store the other day.	Was it an intruder?  Did it get you?  What did it do to your car??"
"No, I was checking out when I saw it happen. I didn't even know them. I don't know why anyone would do something like that.	That's the worst. That's the thing about people, they don't know any boundaries...they just go whenever...and they're never very good at keeping things secure"
"Had my first trekking expereince in the canyon last week. It payed off using all the things i learned during the scouts when i was small!	Wow how rewarding! Were you afraid at all while using the Expereience?"
"I did. the scenes were really rewarding. also felt good to have all the tools and skills necessary	how far did the canyon go?"
"Last week I saw a three piece rock band that sounded so huge that I was sure they were playing with a backing track. I asked their tech, and checked their equipment and guess what!? It was just them!	What rock band is it?"
"I'm sorry if I was unclear, I mean that the band were playing completely live (with no backing track).	That is crazy! I guess live drums and no mixing sounds better."
"So I learned to bowl using two hands yesterday and it was my best game ever!	That's pretty cool! I never really played, but I heard of others!"
"Yes, very! It's also way more fun for me to put spin on the ball than traditional style bowling.	That is cool! How long did it take you to improve your bowling skills?"
"So I came home to dog poop everywhere yesterday! It was gross!	That must have been so disgusting!"
"We were only gone for 2 hours! You just can't leave them alone I guess	That's awful! I would take that dog home and take him in!"
"I am starting a new phase in my life. Completed all debt and off to a new start	That's awesome! Congratulations! What are you getting into?"
"yes very. but I know that it will be good.	That's awesome! How did you get debt?"
"Thanks! I hope to learn from my mistake and continue to progress	What mistake was it?"
"I try to be. it can be difficult on some days, but I think I have a good attitude towards most things	What was the mistake?"
"I'm feeling very motivated and good about school this year. I think I can get much better grades this time.	School can really make you do things you aren't expecting to, good for you!"
"Thanks! I've realized that school is extremely important and I can't squander my opportunity away.	That's great. I went to college for a few years, but have dropped out."
"My friend bought a house in a very cheap market town and 6 months later a very walthy company opened an enormous regional HQ there. His house has doubled in price and he has paid off all his debt and now is very well off. I'm pleased for him but envy a little luck	He is lucky, but you can be too too overconfident."
"Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!	It is really great when something like that happens though, so you are happy about that as well"
"So yesterday I went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand... I went with it.	I have done that more than once.  It can be very embarrassing.  Are you bowling for a living?"
"No, but I was shocked at how a small 12 pound ball can carry you down the lane due to the momentum. It was quite funny.	That bowling is so much fun! How did you do?"
"My brother got a nice new toyota 4runner for his first car! I'm lowkey kind of mad at him for it.	That's cool!  What kind of toyota?"
"No kidding! I hope he understands the value of it!	I would be too! Those are nice cars"
"I just got a new car and I absolutely love it! My old car was a piece of crap so an upgrade is awesome!	Nice! I bet it feels great to have new stuff to your life!"
"I am very happy! It's nice to know that I don't have to worry about if my car is going to start or not either.	Nice! What kind of car is it?"
"I was listening to a throwback hits playlist and it brought back memories from the good ol days.	What a nostalgic place those nostalgic emotions can sometimes."
"It was mostly hip hop and R&B. Stuff like Nelly Furtado, 2pac, etc.	I love nostalgic listens"
"My grandson was admitted to the hospital the other day. It's so hard waiting around for test results.	oh no!! i'm so sorry! I hope everything is okay"
"They still have more tests to do. Hopefully they will know something by tomorrow but it's so nerve wracking.	Oh wow! That's terrible!!! What a difficult phone call to make! I hope he pulls through!"
"I am so excited - after a year of misery due to my loud, inconsiderate upstairs neighbors I'm finally moving into a new apartment!	That's great! Congrats! I'm sure that they are very happy as well! I'm looking to buy a new apartment as well."
"I just can't wait! I've seen the new place, and it backs onto a forest, so there'll be peace there, at least!	That's great! I moved into one this summer, it was very noisy but so much better than my old place."
"Yes it is. And friends are going to help me with moving. It'll be great fun - we can have a bit of a party while they help me unpack :)	I was bowling last week and I accidentally used the person's custom ball that was next to me!	Oh no! Did the person say anything to you about it??"
"It was a she! And she just glared at me. I felt awful when I realized my mistake.	She may not have known that it was you bowling. She could have still looked over to see if you were ok"
"We have a family reunion planned for next week. I am really looking forward to catching up with everyone, especially my brother and sister.	Family reunions are always fun! Are you going with anyone? :)"
"It's been over a year and we don't get to talk very often because everyone is always so busy. I'm so excited.	Family reunions are so much fun! I hope your family and I can make time for you!"
"I recently hit a new personal record at the gym! I was very excited.	What was it?"
"Thank you! I didn't feel like I would ever be able to do it, but consistency does seem to pay off.	That's awesome. Any idea why you took the record? Were you training for a race or for a gym membership?"
"I have a feeling that the rest of this year is going to be great to me! I'm already working out and just have good vibes about the upcoming months.	That's awesome! What are you planning on becoming a nurse for?"
"I have but I've never really stuck to it. This time is different though, I've been going for a few months and feeling great about the future	That's good! What have you changed?"
"My brother got a custom-made bowling ball, and ever since then he's been killing the game! It is awesome to see.	How long has he been playing? Does he have a long stroke?"
"He's on his high school bowling team, but I think he mainly plays for fun. It's kind of cool seeing him get so much better over time.	Does he practice a lot?"
"Ok, so the people upstairs were making a terrible noise last night and I'd had enough. I put jazz on quite loudly and went to bed. I really shouldn't have done that!	Uhmnnn!  Thats no good!!"
"Well, they were shouting and stomping around, so I lost it! This morning, they've been quiet as church mice, so I guess it worked :)	That's hilarious. I love prank calling my bosses!"
"Yeah, I really do feel bad, but it's been going on for over a year.	That must have been quite annoying for you. Were they being loud and vulgar or were they being peaceful?"
"Perhaps I'll try classical music next time - that might totally shut them up, lol.	Maybe, or maybe you just need new friends.  I have had that problem too. I play the guitar a lot, but I don't have anyone to play with."
"I was watching my dad's house last week and I heard some odd noises while I was there alone.	probably someone playing a prank on you"
"No kidding! Once I came back to the kitchen and the faucet was running even though I hadn't touched it.	Hmmm that is really weird. Did the sound come back after a short period?"
"I didn't see my parents since 2014! They live in a different country. I'm finally going to see them next week and I Just CAN'T wait!!	That's awesome! I love when you get a surprise visit!"
"I know! And they've never met their grandson so they will be so excited to finally meet him	wow that is so cool. I bet he or she is very excited as hell."
"I can't help but think back to the good old days at Christmas time.	I love those special moments"
"I'm sorry. That makes me really sad. We lived in a great neighborhood growing up and our neighbors were like family and always got together to celebrate.	I know what you mean. I live in a small town right outside of Atlanta. Christmas came so quickly back then!"
"The last time I went into a job interview, I knew as soon as I walked out that I would be getting a job offer. I felt I did really well.	Congratulations, I know you must have felt good about the interview!"
"Definitely. You go through so many it's easy to feel down.	I agree, I know I did my research and that I will definitely land something soon"
"Last winter I was out on my porch at 4 am. Suddenly a large figure dressed in black was walking towards me. My heart was beating like a drum!	Did he scare you?"
"I wasn't sure at first and, being in a wheelchair, had nowhere to go. Then the dark figure stopped in front of me. I thought I'd had it. Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn't sleep, walking her dog!	Haha. That's so creepy! Did you say something to him?"
"It is now. But it sure wasn't at the time. I was frantically looking around for something to beat my ""attacker"" off with!	I stress eat a lot. I decided i need to control it and i didn't eat sweets for more than a week. very proud of myself	That's great! You must be very disciplined. How did it work out for you?"
"I'll try to do my best. i think i will also need to see a doctor. I just don't wanna get obese	You definitely should if you want to stay healthy! Don't listen to those filthy doctors who ignore his hernia!!!"
"My co-worker just bought a brand new car.	Well thats not bad at all"
"I know, me too. I really envy them every day when I get in my beat up chevy that I've been driving for 10 years.	Those things are really dependable."
"i wanna sell my phone so i posted ad on craigslist. i have 3 potential buyers but i'm so scared to meet them . you never know what people intentions are	You should always be paranoid."
"I did but my husband was with me and now he is out of the country for a couple of months so  i will be alone	Oh no! I hate meeting people.  I avoid public events because it isolates you."
"I am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can't wait. It'll be quiet as it looks onto a forest!	That sounds quite peaceful!"
"Not with traffic, but with the people upstairs - they're a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there, so fingers crossed!	Wow that is a pretty weird place to be."
"They're the most selfish, inconsiderate neighbors I have ever had, and I've lived all over the world! I just cannot wait to get into this other place.	Someone stole my identity.	Oh my god! Whoa! Did you have any idea who did it?"
"I don't know. They completely cleaned out my bank account and maxed out my credit cards. I am fuming.	That is not good!  Did they take anything important?"
"i have food on my table, a roof over my head and clothes to wear. I'm happy and thankful	That is pretty good.  I'm glad to here you're feeling content."
"yes. Some people take these things for granted. it's really easy to take things and people for granted	Totally agree. It is nice to have things we don't take for granted sometimes!"
"so i decided to make a blanket and i got a sawing machine and got patterns and stuff. it tuned out to be so easy! I actually made 3 blankets	How did that work out?"
"thank you! I do want to take more and to give them to my friends who recently had babies	that's awesome! blankets are so handy and fun to make! You are very creative and original!"
"I remember being in Scotland and arranging a trip to California to see my then boyfriend. I was so very happy to be seeing him again!	That sounds great.  I've never really been to Scotland.  Did he visit you guys while you were there?"
"Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls. But it was so worth it to speak to each other and I was lucky I could afford to fly out to see him.	That sounds amazing! It was the phone calls that got me too!"
"Me too. That was one of the happiest trips of my life. The happiest was when we got married six months later!	When I spend time with my family, it reminds me how lucky I really am.	That is what makes life fun!"
"Definitely. Even when times get rough, there are still so many things to be thankful for. I did not always realize that, but glad I do now.	That is a really good attitude to have.  It is good to realize we can appreciate things more than we know"
"My dog just gave me a bunch of kisses! I love her so much	Awwww that's so sweet!!  What breed is your doggy?"
"She is a golden retriever. Do you have any pets?	I do have a cat. Her names may be Pepper, but she is a mix between Pepper and Dingo :)"
"School starts a week from tomorrow and I am getting fairly nervous for it!	Why are you getting nervous?  Is it an important class?"
"Oh yes, I really like school and my classmates and stuff! I guess just because summer is coming to an end?	I'm sure you'll be fine. Just try to study hard"
"I always say i'm not a judgemental person but in my head i judge everybody and i'm so ahsamed of it	I think we all get a little judge-y in our head. Doesn't hurt to be honest with you."
"yes but when i catch myself judging somebody i feel so guilty and bad	I know the feeling. Sometimes i even forget how bad it really is."
"I've already gotten my school supplies and everything is ready! I feel like I'm gonna kill this semester.	That's awesome! I bet you'll do awesome! What are you getting in too?"
"I will try! It will be hard with a part-time job but I bet I can manage.	That's the spirit! You will do it!"
"My brother just turned 16 and he's about to get his first car! I'm so excited for him.	That's awesome, I wish I had a brother! What kind of car?"
"Probably some kind of SUV, maybe an Xterra or 4runner. Should be awesome when he gets it!	I wish I had a brother like you, I would be the perfect age to be excited for my brother!"
"I've been saving up for a new car for the past month and am making great progress!	What kind of car is it"
"I want an SUV, like an Xterra or 4runner. They are pricy though!	I know the feeling! My father in laws old Grand Cherokee was a dream car! Just under 200K miles on her!"
"Recently my husband and I were traveling home from visiting his family when all of a sudden a car cuts us off	Were you scared? I bet that was scary!  Did you end up driving home safely?"
"I have no idea how we didn't hit them but it was so scary	Oh no! Did you end up driving home safely?"
"My oldest child's birthday is next week and it always makes me emotional.	Children are a very complicated subject. It's easy to put onto a person because of their past, present and future. I can see why you'd feel emotional, however!"
"She will be 30. It makes me feel so old, but also how fun it was when they were little.	I know what you mean. I was just talking about that with my friend last week. It's so nice to remember all those great times with your kid"
"I feel so much better about myself and life in general now that I	that's good! What made you feel better about yourself?"
"Sorry, I accidentally hit enter haha. Now that I've been working out for about a month!	That's great! It's nice to be forgiving!"
"I just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time. I've found my perfect restaurant/store and spent a very happy 40 mins or so wandering around it.	That sounds great! It can be very different when it is a ""new"" restaurant. Was it one you really liked?"
"Yes, it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans, which are delicious!	that is awesome that you had a chance to taste some indian food! i love it when i go to amsterdam and find some indian dishes"
"They're the same shape as regular green beans, but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.	I have never had green beans. You are enlightening me."
"What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange, different things to try!	That sounds awesome! I love that it is local, I may have to go there tomorrow!"
"I came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!	why did he do that? did he do sometING horrible?"
"Like he jumped out from behind a door and scared me. I was not expecting it!	Did he jump scare you? I would be scared too!"
"My step dad showed me a cut he got while working on his boat and I could see his muscle fibers. I almost puked.	That is so cool and inspiring! How long has it been since he last saw you?"
"Yeah it was gross. He probably should get stitches.	Did you ask your dad about the stitches?"
"When I heard Anthony Bourdin had taken his own life, I was so shocked and upset. He gave so much pleasure to a lot of people, yet was miserable in his own life.	That's so sad! I was a little sad too when I read about that. He was a nice guy in his younger years."
"It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!	Yes! I agree completely. Anthony Bourdin is such an inspiration, but he was certainly an unfortunate person to live such a self-defeating lifestyle. It's truly inspiring to hear such tragic stories like this one. I think mental health is just going to get a little more recognized as we move closer to our Golden"
"Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.	I know right? Who sent you to this website? Some sock puppets, I guess..."
"There's so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it's disgusting.	I hadn't been able to see my grandmother in quite some time b/c she lives so far away	How's it been? Have you seen her lately?"
"Well I was finally able to go and visit her and the house and visit was exactly as I remembered it as a child.  It gave me such great memories!	That's awesome! I love grandparenting! You're definitely one of the lucky ones."
"I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel, I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport's history!	That's so amazing. I'm glad that you got a chance to be there and witnessed it live. I'm also really jealous."
"Yeah, for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what's fun rather than what you were aiming to do, if you get me. We went from sports bar to sports bar trying to see who would show the event and by the time we gave up we'd had such a funny night and the race had turned out great!	I remember that too, sports are so boring for everyone."
"I didn't know until the other day that kids have different teachers for different subjects starting in 5th grae.	What is the different subject?"
"That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.	Yeah it really does, it makes you think about it too, how did you learn that in the past"
"That's true - when I was in kindergarten, we only went for half the day.	When I lived in California my farmer friend and landlord had me get organized and have all my valuables together in case of a big earthquake. He stockpiled such things as batteries and water.	Oh wow, that sounds like an amazing thing to do! Did it work out well?"
"It feels good to get everything together, doesn't it? You feel as if you're ready for anything!	That sounds amazing! I am so thankful for having so many things like that."
"I like that saying - it's very good advice. I'm all for advance action as it saves headaches (or worse!) later on.	i'm so proud of my son! He learned a couple of words this week. He now knows how to ay please	Wow that's great! How old is he?"
"he actually speaks 2 languages. I teach him english and russian	that's great, it's amazing how some little things can change your life!"
"A while back my loud upstairs neighbors went away for a week. My life went from night to day. It just felt as if all was right in my world.	That sounds very relaxing.  Were they gone for long?"
"Funny you should mention that - in three weeks time, lol.	Oh wow, that is a long time. Were they gone for good or did they go away for vacation?"
"No, moving to a 1-bedroom apartment. I don't have a girlfriend - I had a husband, but we split up.	I found a cat in my attic yesterday!	You must be thrilled. Was it a stray?"
"My husband is allergic to cats to, I'm not sure how it got there. We had to call animal control to get it out safely!	That's a really awesome thing you did. I would do the same. I am allergic to dogs and cats too but, since my cat is in one piece and my dog is not, I couldn;t get any of the other two to.,"
"My best friend's long-term relationship ended abruptly a while back, just after her father passed. I'm so full of admiration for her - instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy-depressed, she pulled herself together and made a new, exciting life her new reality.	Wow. That sounds like incredible chapters from a book. I am happy for both of you."
"Yes, she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there, she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!	That sounds amazing, I would be crazy to do anything to hurt someone. You are wonderful for being able to support her so well."
"She's a very strong person and she also has lots of friends and family to help her. She's a lovely person and deserves the best in life!	I just got Hulu Live. It's been amazing to watch TV again!	I've been looking for a way to watch it outside of the country."
"I love to watch Home shows on HGTV and Bachelor in Paridise on ABC. Hulu live has been a great value for the price!	HALO is great. I watch a lot of Disney shows there."
"My husband ran over a cat this morning on accident, I'm so upset.	That sucks!  Did he say anything to you?"
"Yes, we had to call animal control to retreive the body! I hope it wasn't someone pet.	Oh god, that's awful, how horrible! I hope it wasn't a stray or someone you knew?"
"I couldn't imagine losing all 3 of my kids in a fire.	I can't either! That's so tragic. What happened?"
"Yes, I heard about it. Such a sad story.	I'm so sorry to hear that. How did it happen?"
"My friends threw an unexpected birthday party for me. I thought they'd forgotten..	Was it your birthday?"
"I did! It was a very nice gesture.	That is such a thoughtful thing to do for you!  Did they get a lot of presents?"
"We are waiting on military orders right now, I'm so hoping they come through next week.	Oh, I wish we could get some type of order, ""Make Your Wishlist"" or something?"
"Yes, we know where we are going just haven't gotten the official orders.	Where are you stationed?"
"I get so tired of hearing about people being mean to animals.	I get where you're coming from. Have you had an animal roommate?"
"Right, these poor animals have no clue why people are mean to them. Some people are heartless.	i get what you meam"
"For some reason I've been thinking of our family Christmases back when I was a kid. I so enjoyed decorating the tree, helping my Mom with preparing lunch. And of course, eating Christmas lunch! Fun times.	I used to do that too when I was little"
"It's nice to think back, tho' and relive the old days. We have our own traditions now, but the good old days will always remain just that!	I know what you mean.  I think of mine sometimes also."
"It's funny, we always remember the successful, fun times and forget about the not-so-perfect things. Must be our minds' defense kicking in!	Do you know anyone who spends a ton on eating out every week? It's crazy to me how much they spend.	yes! I know someone who lives with his parents and spends hours every day shopping!"
"Yes, exactly. A friend was telling me they spent almost $300 a week on eating out. I don't even spend that much on groceries.	I am sorry to hear that.  What does your friend do for work if you don?"
"We are moving soon and I'm so ready to go.	Where to? Whats happening?"
"Texas, there's so much to do there so I'm happy for the change.	That sounds awesome. Are you moving away from home to begin your new adventure?"
"Awesome, my husband is Air Force and we have been in Mississippi for 4 years. Texas sounds better.	I was worried because the weather man said a hurricane was coming. So we got everything ready just in case.	That's good thinking.  I hope it's not as bad as the weather has been this week!"
"So true. Luckily it didn't get as bad as they thought so we didn't have to evauate.	That's a relief.  I hate those types of situations when it's not your fault!"
"My cousin contacted me the other day via Facebook messenger. She had my twin aunts with her, one of whom I hadn't seen in over five years. It was such a delight to see them and chat with them!	How nice!  I bet that brought back a lot of great memories!"
"Oh yes, and then some! They both looked so well and had lots to say. What a laugh we had. I'm so fortunate to have such a wonderful family!	That's wonderful! I have never used facebook before."
"Yes I am! When I hear how some families are I feel very blessed. They are very special people.	My dog has to have her teeth cleaned on Wednesday and I am really nervous b/c she got super sick last time afterwards	Oh no I hope she is ok! Is this her first time having to do this?"
"She is super tiny and they said with small dogs the stress of the procedure will give them stomach issues sometimes.  I wouldnt even do it except she has an abcess	I am sorry, but I am afraid that you are putting in a bunch of pressure that could put you in an unhealthy situation.  I really hope that it is ok and that you can get her teeth cleaned!"
"Recently my grandma passed away.  she lived pretty far from us most of our lives but at the end she had Alzheimer and so we moved her down to be near us	That's terrible! I am so sorry to hear about your grandma! I lost both of mine, so I can relate. It's so sad."
"Yes, it seemed so.  I really had fun reconnecting with her as an adult, so it was really hard when she passed.	That's terrible, my grandmother passed away a few years ago aswell, so it's not an easy thing for us to lose someone so close to us. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I know it's hard for everyone involved, but it's good that you enjoyed your time with her."
"We broke down and couldn't get help for several hours as we were out of cell range. Good thing I had packed extra food and water.	Oh no that is awful!  I'm glad you were able to get some help!"
"I was very worried but we were lucky eventually and someone stopped and helped and we went on with our vacation.	I'm glad it turned out well for you guys."
"I've been so busy packing, packing and more packing.	I know the feeling! Is it getting late in the year?"
"Yes, don't know exactly when but I hate being rushed so I've been doing what I can.	It is always a rush! I bet you are going to feel better!"
"I recently got married to my best friend. We are older now and are happy with things being low key and staying on a routine.	That is great! It is always good to have a happy marriage. Are they married too?"
"I do feel very lucky, especially to find someone who is as satisfied as I am in our old age.	I am happy for you! It is nice to find someone as happy with themselves as you are!"
"I got to hear a lot of cool songs on a radio station I usually don't listen to.	Oh that's cool! What station did you get to hear this on?"
"Mambo #5, Missy Elliot, and Ricky Martin. It really took me back	I have never heard of those. What songs were they?"
"I took a test for college the other day, it was basically our midterm.	How do you feel now? Did you at least pass?"
"I don't know yet. The wait is killing me and I'm not confident I did well.	I'm sure if you prepared well and studied hard it'll turn out good eventually."
"Discrete mathematics	I was watching the Scottish Open golf tournament a few weeks ago. I know a guy who was playing in it. Guess what? He won! Fantastic four days of baited breath and cheering him on!	Four days? You must have been so excited! Did he get any gifts?"
"He's playing in the PGA Championship right now or I'm sure he'd be delighted to, lol!	He must be so full of joy!"
"You got it! I've been watching him play for a while now and it's such a fantastic feeling to see him win - and in his own country too!	Wow, that's awesome! He must be so proud. I hope he wins."
"Thank you - he'd appreciate it. It makes tournaments so much more interesting when you know some people involved.	I love teaching people how to skydive - it is so much fun helping them to learn.	it's amazing the amount of people who would believe that"
"There are skydiving centers all over the world.  What part of the country are you in?  It is an amazing sport.	I'm in the midwest. I was just in an instructor's class over in youtube and it was so cool! The guy was teaching his kid how to do tricks!"
"There is Skydive Orange and Virginia Skydiving Center.  I grew up near Richmond!	Everyone in my family laughs at me b/c I am super organized and I like routine in my life	Oh I bet! It must make you so happy!"
"Exactly!  I always joke that I use to be a boyscout b/c their motto is ""Always be prepared""	What do you do for a living"
"You know when you see the perfect house to rent and someone beats you to it? That happened to me recently - the owners rented it out the night before I was to see it :(	I know that feeling, my friend! I had the perfect place to live when we moved and the market crashed. I was so frustrated and jealous, until I saw that my friend had managed to get it for me!"
"Yes, but it's an apartment and this place was a lovely quiet 3 bed/2 bath place in a lovely neighborhood. Such a bummer!	I am sorry to that! I am sure you will find something even better."
"I'm sure I will so long as I have good neighbors. I'm over the first place now, but it wasn't pleasant to be pipped at the post!	my horse died last week i was devastated when i found out	Oh no! How old was it"
"yeah the vet told us it was cancer i was really sad	Oh man I'm sorry, that's really awful to hear! How long did you have it for?"
"i am always outside my house beafore my friend gets here	Do you enjoy your privacy?"
"i know he is comming i just like to be there couple of mins before he arrives	Sounds like you really trust your friend!"
"i was really happy the day i finished my doctorate	What did you get your doctorate in?"
"yeah it really took a lot of hard work to do it but it was worth it at the end	Well, that's good. What are you studying now?"
"in science of medicine it was really a fun exppirience	My wife has been out of the country for 2 months, and is getting back in a week.  I'm super pumped!	Where have she been."
"No, taking a language course to help her graduate studies.  Good guess though :P	Haha! Why a language class?  She'll learn so much!"
"My wife is coming back into the country after being away for 2 months.  I've got to do some cleaning before she gets back :P	Aww, you better make some quick stops! before she realizes it's time to go."
"Most definitely.  I'm not worried about her being terribly mad, but it's nice to come home to a clean house.	A bit of a clean house will do the trick :)  And she's coming back, that's exciting!"
"i burned my hair with my hair drier i am so embarrased to go out in public	I'm so sorry to hear that... did it happen in the shower or at home?  Did you dry it yourself or hire someone to do it for you?"
"yeah it is the worst, i loook so weird with my hair like this it is so embarassing	i have long hair, i can't do anything with mine"
"I had a bad experience out to eat the other day.  I don't do it too often, so it was a bummer.	Oh, what happened?"
"The food was pretty bad and the service didn't help clear things up.  There were a lot of mistakes on top of everything.  Just general bad eating out things.	What things were you having problems with?"
"I was walking through the grocery store the other day and wasn't watching where I was going and knocked over an entire display.	What?! I am so sorry that happened. Did anyone notice?"
"It was too much of a mess to clean up and I couldn't sneak away because there were several people who saw me do it. My face was bright red.	That is too funny!  People are so nasty!  I bet your embarrassed!"
"My wife has been out of the country for two months and is getting back in a week.	Where has she been?"
"Definitely :)  It's been a long and lonely summer :)	Aww, I am glad she is back!  Where has she been?  Do you have any plans with her to visit?"
"I recently moved from California to North Carolina and suddenly realized I knew absolutely nobody. It was a horrible feeling.	Oh wow. I've lived in both those places. I know a lot of the people, but it's always tough leaving some established people behind. How did it feel moving from the South?"
"My rent tripled in three years. I couldn't afford to stay - just too expensive. Anyway, a friend had driven across with me and it wasn't until he'd gone that I realized I was alone. Silly, huh?!	Yea that is pretty silly. I moved to Colorado from Virginia three years ago, and I didn't know anyone in either place either. I hate living alone."
"The two things I found that were really bad were rents and gas. Everything else was pretty much the same as other places I've lived. So sad - where I lived was lovely.	Yikes that sucks! I'm glad you escaped your situation. I'm sure it was hard to leave."
"The North is my favorite area - north of San Francisco. Where did you go?	I'm in the Midwest. I was so sad when I moved to a new state. Everything around me was the same. It's just a dump. I moved to Texas and it's pretty nice."
"A while ago I drove from Florida to Northern California. It's a long trip, but I knew I could do it just fine.	Did you have any issues? I've always wanted to take a journey to the South through the US."
"It took about 5 days. I would drive a few hours and stop for the night. I'd already made the trip from West to East, so kind of knew what I was doing.	Wow! That sounds super fun! How far did it drive you?"
"Oh no - I'm not a race car driver, lol. And anyway, it's kind of fun seeing different parts of the country, so rushing would (to me) be a waste.	My wife was really sick the other day, she was stuck in bed for most of the day.	Oh my goodness! How horrible! How is she feeling now/"
"Not completely sure, maybe just a stomach bug or something.  She's ok now, though her appetite took a bit to come back.	That's good.  Were her periods any good?"
"summer was so boring for me, im really happy school is starting again	School is always a fun time for me as well.  Where did you go?"
"not really, i just stayed home all summer because my parents worked the whole summer as well as i did	That sucks.  That sucks how summer goes by so fast."
"My mom is having weight loss surgery next week, I'm nervous.	That's awful! I hope she doesn't get hurt.  What is the plan to help her lose weight?"
"She is having gastric bypass surgery, I feel like it would be too dangerous due to her medical state. She wont listen to me!	I don't blame you for being nervous. I hope she will make it.  It can be dangerous to lose weight at young ages"
"there is nothing i hate more than losing in something	I'm the same! I'm constantly checking to make sure that I lost before someone can get it!"
"not recently but gettting last at a race really makes me angry and motivates me	I feel your pain! It's like losing in arisal race or losing at poker!"
"It has been a wonderful Monday!	Why is that"
"I found out a got a pay raise at my job, we are starting to plan a cruise for the holidays in November!	Wow you must be so excited! Where are you going in too go?"
"I read in the news about a family who lost all six of their animals in a house fire :(	That's so sad! How awful for the family!"
"I know, it made me upset! My two dogs are my babies couldn't imagine loosing them.	That's awful!  I'm so sorry.  I know how devastating it must have felt."
"my dog is over at the vet for 4 days and makes the house feel so alone'	Aw, I'm sorry to hear it. I hope she feels better!"
"yeah i am really looking forward to getting him back	That's too long, is he being sweet?"
"My wife went out of the country for a couple months at the beginning of the summer, dropping her off at the airport was really tough.	Oh no! Did you find her? Did she stay a while?"
"Not for more than a few days.  It's been a rough couple months, but it's almost over!	I am glad that she is back!"
"When my wife and I had to move for her to go to school, we had a lot of trouble finding a place to live until my parents were nice enough to cosign on a loan.	What a blessing and a curse that was."
"We are.  They've helped a lot during my life, but this might have been the biggest one.	That is so wonderful of them!"
"i cant wait to visit my family back home they are so far away i dont get to see them a lo	I'm jealous. I love traveling, and my wife's family just moved about an hour away. I'm so jealous!"
"in a couple of weeks i am really happy to see them it has been 5 years	That's awesome. Do you guys live near the city limits?"
"i cant get near spiders, even if i see them in pictures they freak me out	I'm with ya there! They are creepy"
"not really i was just born afraid of them hahah	I think they're creepy, but they also make good pets!"
"A few years ago, before we got married, my wife planned a party for me for my birthday completely without me knowing.	That is so thoughtful! What was the plan was."
"It really was!  I walked into my apartment to like 15 more people than I expected.	Wow! That must've been a very nice surprise party!"
"i hate when my little brother throws food on the table just to annoy m e	That would be so annoying! What does he normally do that you can't do anything about it?"
"he is like 11 but he does it when my parents are not home it is really anoying	That's so funny!  Hey little brothers, get out of here!"
"I was stopped at a traffic light when a woman in a truck scraped slowly along the side of my car.	Were you nervous?"
"Yeah, we both stopped and pulled over.  I think she was high or something, she was really off.	That's unfortunate, but maybe she had a valid excuse to go somewhere."
"i found a little ball of hair when i was eating at a fancy restaurant	That's gross! I hope it didn't ruin the meal?"
"yeah i did, they gave us a refund and we did not come back to that place again	that is not cool, did you tell the restaurant?"
"I had made plans for dinner and had set everything out and I found out my husband ate all the bread!	Oh no! That's so disappointing. I would have been upset!"
"It wasn't even garlic bread! It was generic bread to dip in soup!	Oh no! I hate when my husband does that! Did you say something?"
"i feels surprised	why is that? what do you feel surprised about?"
"my boy friend gives me a birthday gift surprisingly	What did your friend give you as a gift?"
"My neighbor used to have an old beagle - a lovely pooch. He died of cancer just before Thanksgiving. I looked for him for weeks - I miss him.	Oh no, be careful, it is one year older now. It is sad to think that could happen to anyone.  Be happy that he is in a good place now - and looking forward to the holidays with you :)"
"Yeah. I used to see him when I was out on my porch and he'd come out for a sniff around or a tinkle. He was so sweet and gentle.	Awe. Beagles are such good companions."
"They sure are. I actually prefer them to some humans I know! Do you have a dog at the moment?	I do not! I don't know if it helps, but my aunt rescued from a shelter, so when we got him he looked just like my aunt. Except he was a little taller, and lanker. He was cute. But now... Not so much lol"
"That's wonderful, that you were able to take her in. Good for you! More people should act like that.	I have two dogs. I prefer one over the other but I still have other dogs I have to train. I'm very glad they were there to comfort you."
"I'm not a very good cook but sometimes my husband scares me with it!	Uh oh! What happens when he scares you?!"
"He was putting chocolate right into the chilli the other night!	Oh my goodness. That's one of my pet peeves. Why don't you let him put the chocolate into the chilli first, so it's not lump sum of course, but at least put it in the right chilli. You're better than me, I know."
"My son came home today and was working on his homework.	Did he get all of it?"
"In 7th and they're doing pre algebra. He said he didn't know it, then proceeded to get every question right!	That must be a great feeling of accomplishment! I don't have mygebra down yet but I know my son knows how to do basic math so it should feel pretty good."
"I've been training hard for a marathon next week, and I am beating my record time!	What is the race? Sounds like you trained very hard!"
"For a few months now, but I've been training pretty hard just these past few months.	Oh that's awesome! what marathons are you doing?"
"I'm very socially awkward and tomorrow i'm going to have a playdate with some local moms and i'm so anxious	sounds like fun i'm doing one with my mom! i'm very happy for you!"
"that's a great idea! thank you for a great advice.	Local moms? Oh my goodness, you're very bold!! I'm a mom, too! But I totally understand why being social would make you anxious, too! I hope it goes well for you."
"I recently went to ruby falls, an underground cavern with a waterfall.	I have never heard of it! Sounds cool!"
"Not that particular one, no. I had butterflies in my stomach on that elevator going down 23 stories.	That sounds so awesome!"
"Overall it was a good time, but i was nervous being that far underground, i need to learn to relax and enjoy things.	I had some hesitations when I was at the gym today, thought I wouldn't be able to handle the weights	How much do you lift?"
"I decided to focus on the music that was blasting, just tried switching up what I play in the gym, it sounds like vikings are bringing me into battle	What is your favorite music to play at gym?"
"Have you ever been in a car crash before?	Yes, I was in a car wreck one time.  I felt so numb when it happened!"
"I got T-boned once, I'll never forget spinning around in that car, hearing the tires squalling. It was really scary.	Yes, I have actually been in a car crash. It is terrifying!"
"My wife has been really sad here recently, I've had to hold her while she cries herself to sleep at night.	That sucks.  I hope you two can talk it out!"
"Shes lost a lot of loved ones this summer. We've been to 4 funerals, and the most recent one was really hard on her.	That's so sad. It's so nice you are there for her. I'm sorry you're having to go through that. Have you tried to keep her company and cheer her up?"
"My bank, which I've had a savings account with for over 10 years has been deducting $15/month from me for ""inactivity"". How about that?	that is really bad"
"Very true. They didn't even tell me. That was the last thing I expected! I only just decided to use it again.	I would expect them to at least let you know so that you weren't left with a cliffhanger."
"Yes. They said that they'd been taken over by another bank and it was the previous one which deducted the money. What rubbish. It just amazes me!	Have you ever had a friend or loved one commit suicide.	Yes. Many. Many people have. What's worse; the attempt or the attempt to kill themselves?"
"Yes, my brother in law/childhood friend took his own life. Its been very hard to comes to terms with.	I am very sorry for your brothers' death, that's so sad. But I can understand your feelings too. It can be very upsetting when it's sudden like that."
"Have you ever had a new puppy?	Yes I have"
"Yeah, he keeps pooping in the floor! He's learning to go outside, but I'm so tired of stepping in doggy poo at 3am!	I have 3 rescue cats. They are the worst! I had one who had to have his stomach pumped and now he's just laying around waiting for his siblings."
"I store my chocolate in the fridge to make sure that it stays cold and solid. I was storing my last piece in there	You're a good person!"
"Last night I wasn't in a great mood and wanted that last piece to help cheer me up a bit and it was gone!	What was it that made you want to keep that piece in there?"
"I ran into my neighbor's mailbox with my car but didn't stop and leave a note.	Did you miss your mailbox?"
"I agree, I felt so bad about it. When I saw him replacing it, I went out and confessed.	He's probably just out for his money."
"i'm so stressed. we are struggling financially and i don't even know how are we going to pay rent this month	Are you working?"
"thank you for your support! and to make things worse i broke a ceiling light yesterday and we are renting this apartment so i have to replace it and it's expensive	Oh no that's horrible! I am so sorry! You're lucky to be in an apartment, but I know you must be real tough on the financial side."
"My mom made a pretty awesome scrapbook and gave it to me for christmas several years ago. I recently dug it out and went through it.	what did you use it for?"
"Photos from my whole life growing up, with sections about my relationships with each sibling. pretty awesome.	That is really cool.  Were you surprised to see your life flash before your eyes in that moment?"
"I once was taking a big trip I had been looking forward to and the day before we leave for an international flight a high level travel advisory was issued for the area we were going.	Oh wow. Did it turn out alright?"
"No. We went ahead and went on. It actually turned out to be a great trip with zero incidents.	That's good, travel is so exciting!"
"Yeah. Glad we didnt bail.	thats cool"
"No. Best I can remember it didnt even rain.	I hate it when plans fall through. I really wanted to spend my time on the water this last weekend.	Oh that's terrible! Well next weekend may not work out since the weather has been bad this weekend."
"I was going to Florida to go on a multi-day canoeing and camping trip. At the last minute, the two people I was going with backed out, and I simply couldn't afford to go alone.	Ah, that is a bummer! Well at least you didn't miss out on much if you were more than a couple hours away."
"My grandpa always said he was a rockstar back in his day, but I never believed him.	Well, you are more gullible than me.  I am sure your parents picked up on that line."
"I don't know if he was famous, but the other day, he got on stage, bit the head off of a bat, then belted the words to Crazy Train. It was unbelievable!	Lol that sounds like a crazy story! Sounds like he was a cool dude!"
"I used to do flooring work, we had to deal with some pretty strange situations sometimes.	flooring work can be strange. was it an emergency or a scheduled thing?"
"well, one time we had to replace the subfloor where a man had died and his cats had started to eat him. was revolting.	Oh my god! I could not handle that at all! Were the cats okay"
"It really bothers me that my son sticks his dirty socks in the toy box	You mean the floor. That's what happens when you don't clean your toys. I taught him that"
"I guess so haha but no matter what I try to keep him from doing it, it still happens	That's a shame! Does he not keep them in the same bucket?"
"I recently had my hip-length hair cut for the first time in years.	How did it go?"
"It was kind of scraggly on the ends. It took me some time to get used to the new cut, but it looks much thicker and healthier now.	How did you feel when you did the cut?"
"I went around work all day today with a hole in my pants, right on my bottom.	Wow! Did anyone see it"
"Yep! No one told me. :( I have no idea how many people noticed or saw it.	Must've been quite embarrassing! Did anyone give you tips?"
"I paid $1000 for one of those mystery boxes on eBay. It said it would be filled with all sorts of fun and expensive items.	That is a really cool prize! What did you end up getting in the mystery box?"
"I would've happily taken that! Instead, it was filled with literal garbage, like a bunch of those empty 99 Bananas bottles and candy wrappers.	That's the worst, it's like they don't understand how much money you're paying or something!"
"I had my final exam for Chemistry today!	Wow! Did you study very hard for it?"
"I'm pretty sure I Aced it! I've been studying for weeks.	Nice! Chemistry is really hard, I'm proud of you!"
"It can be rough when I have a problem and need to vent to someone	I know the feeling. Do you have a good ventracker?"
"You are sweet because part of the problem is when I realize there really is no one to talk to. Thank you	Yes there really isnt.  Its like a disease..  If only we knew how to get it under control."
"I've been training a new girl at work this week!	oh thats cool"
"She's doing great, especially for her second week on the job!	That is great! I bet she is proud of you!"
"I've already been shopping for christmas, I'm excited!	Well then I'm excited too! Where have you been checking?"
"I know, it's my favourite time of year! Makes me happy :)	Me too! I love the weather, the shopping and the people. What's your favorite part about Christmas?"
"I was just at the casino, spent almost 100 dollars on a single machine. I didn't will anything.	Wow! Did they give you anything in return for it?  Did they let you win any money on the machine?"
"Haha, yeah I got a little sauced. The worst part though was as soon as I got up, someone sat down and  rolled triple 7s.	I love playing blackjack!  What machine did you go on?"
"I used to get supremely scared when I wanted to go up stairs when the lights were off	Why were you scared"
"Yeah, so I would book it up the stairs as fast as possible	Lightning always scares me. I'm pretty tall and I hate being out in the dark."
"I just got matched up with someone online. It will be my first date in a while.	I hope it goes well!"
"Yeah, I'm really hoping to make a good impression. Other wise that would feel pretty bad.	Don't worry too hard about it. Just enjoy yourself. If they are good looking chances they most probably are local."
"Tomorrow is the big day, I have to deliver my proposal to the client.	I am sure it is exciting"
"I have been preparing for weeks, but in the back of my mind I still have doubts.	Confirm the proposal then."
"My boyfriend's cat wakes me up every morning at 4 AM.	That's pretty annoying. Why don't you get a cat?"
"I love him, too, a lot. But I don't know why he just stands in the hallway and meows nonstop, even when he's been fed.	That is strange. He could just need a cat scratching post."
"Ashe. He's cute :)	I'm finally almost done with my associate's degree! I technically started wayyyy back in 2011, but I just got serious in 2016.	Congrats! That's awesome. What are you studying?"
"Thank you. :) I only have three classes left to take. I'm so excited.	Congratulations!!! I wish you all the luck!"
"Thanks a lot ;)	Playing hookey can be really fun. But sometimes it backfires...	Like every time! What do you lose if you do it wrong?"
"When I was a teenager, I called in to the restaurant and told them I had to pick up my grandmother from an aiport hours away. Wouldn't you know it my family came in (including my grandma) and asked to be sat in my section!	Hokey was a big influence on my childhood. I bet it was fun!"
"Sometimes I enjoy being alone, but not on a long trip that takes me far away from home.	I do too, sometimes I enjoy being by myself for a while."
"This was a while back, but I planned a bicycle trip that went across several states. Although I had a buddy coming with me originally, he ended up bailing and I went alone. I called it quits halfway.	That was really cool of you to do. I'm pretty sure most people would've just gone with him, but wanted to make a different trip."
"I have a beautiful girl friend. But I met someone else.	That can be upsetting. Have things worked out in their relationship?"
"I'm trying to figure out how to kick her out of my place.	That really stinks, I'm sorry. Can't you just break things off?"
"I just watched the ring movie for the first time.	what movie? did you like it?"
"I can't even sleep with the lights off now for the last few days.	What was it? I can't believe I forgot this was a thing"
"Once I took a sip of iced tea while I was driving and it went down the wrong pipe. I had to pull over so I could try to breathe again.	Haha, that's terrible.  It would have sucked more if it had been coffee!  Did you end up able to breath okay?"
"Yeah it is. I thought I was about to die lol	Haha that's terrible...but funny at the same time!"
"My cashier gave me extra change back and I didn't say anything.	That's always nice. Did you have something to buy?"
"Because I had also stolen some candy and wanted to get out as soon as possible.	That's a bummer.  Did you have to pay cashiers for not doing their job?"
"A man came to my door with a gun, asking for money.	Oh my god! That's so scary! Did he come with a bomb too?"
"I did not know him. He took some items from the house as I didn't have any money on me	What did you do after he took your stuff?"
"I like finding little resources or tips that change old habits I've been coping with in what seems like ""1 easy step""	Yes! Sometimes people get lost in a clutter. Do you find value in learning new things?"
"Exactly, I started taping my mouth closed at night, finally woke up before noon, mission accomplished	That's a pretty noble gesture to take the attention to. I'm happy for you! tips like this can really make a big impact."
"I started taping my mouth closed before bed, and now I'm no longer tired when I wake up, feels like I am born again	thats awesome, its always good to wake up with some confidence"
"Yeah, it	is that good or bad"
"I use band aid tape cuz it's okay on the skin	Sometimes life just hits you on the head with a good time. Like the other day when I went to the park with my girlfriend.	Life truly is a blessing, isn't it? How long have you been together?"
"It was, but not just because of a romantic walk. When we arrived, there was a festival with games, performances and a fireworks display after sunset! It was incredible!	that sounds amazing!"
"I was trying to study for a final but my neighbors were being really loud, and I had a hard time focusing	oooh I feel you. I had that problem as well"
"No, I'm shy and try to avoid confrontation as much as possible	Try not to let it bother you. I think if you try to focus on being quiet they won't bother you."
"I really should have switched banks a long time ago. Nobody over there knows their head from their butt!	What do they do?"
"That sounds truly bizarre! I guess I am still angry because the other day they froze my card, and due to a teller's mistake actually had to take my current card and mail me a new one!	That is terrible!! I hate when they make you pay for a mistake they made at a store"
"I went to a bar I used to go to in college, and I was surprised to see an arcade machine I built with a dear friend of mine!	Did you guys play it?"
"Yes, playing the machine we built together reminded me of all the good times we used to have.	Aww that is so sweet!  I bet he really miss that friend!"
"I hadn't been to the dentist in five years but made an appointment recently because of a toothache	Glad you got it worked on! Hopefully they know whats wrong."
"I just started to feel a sharp pain in one of my teeth. It might be a cavity or something worse	Ouch! I'm sorry to that. Did the dentist fix the pain?"
"I can't believe I am telling you this, but I actually camped out to buy tickets for the new star wars movie.	Oh really?? You are a dedicated member of your family! You are doing good things"
"I'm glad you don't think so. The kicker is, when I got to the front of the line the guy in front of me got the last two tickets!	That's a bummer. Do you know who won?"
"My girlfriend and I were going to a big parade with some friends. As we were leaving, she tripped on the stairs and hurt her ankle.	That's so bad! I hope she's okay!"
"Unfortunately, it swelled up and she was in no shape to go anywhere. So instead, I stayed with her and watched netflix while we split a pint of icecream.	That sounds like such a romantic and sweet way to end a evening!"
"My cat jumped through the window in the basement and it was the most shocking, but ultimately underwhelming thing	How old was it? It happens to all of us"
"I guess because furry things don't really scare me, I was like well that was a waste of a reaction	Oh my goodness, your cat jumped through a window? That would scare me too, I would've ran away. How big was your cat?"
"I was getting mad at the weights in the gym to see how much I could lift	How much can you lift?  I have always wanted to be able to do pullups!"
"No not really, just seeing how much energy I could summon from within	How long have you been working at this for?  I'm sure if you were really dedicated it probably took a lot longer."
"There's too many things to think about	I know right? What is the number one thing that you are thinking about right now?"
"Yeah, what am I getting myself into	Are we talking about yourself or talking about your significant other?"
"I just finally won some money playing scratch lotto tickets.	Oh wow! How much did you win?"
"Close to $20,000, I think I'm going to spend it on traveling.	Wow, that's impressive! What are you going to do with it?"
"I went to a play recently that was unconventional in a really fun way. It actually took place at a pool.	Was the play very interesting?"
"It was an adaptation of ""The Last Unicorn"". It had parts that took place in the water, and parts that took place on a giant trapeze!	That sounds so awesome! I'm glad it sounded like something I'd be into!"
"I got a new puppy. She's really cute and playful	That sounds like a great addition to your family!"
"I named her Layla.	That's a great name! I have a dog similar, named herLayla :)"
"I recently went to a Steely Dan concert with my lady.	That's cool! Did you guys have a great time?"
"Yeah, it was awesome reminiscing about those times when we used to get in trouble back in the day... times were so much simpler then.	That is cool.  I love old disney movies!"
"I just got a new puppy, names fido.	Nice. Was it difficult to choose a name?"
"It is a german shepherd. It takes a lot of work caring for it, definitely needs a lot of attention	I love German Shephards. I have 2 of them!"
"On my way to work, a goose stole the toupee I needed to impress the new secretary, Christy.	That is terrible luck! Did they return it?"
"No! I am so furious with that goose, that I could wring his neck! I can't get any ladiez with this chrome dome of mine.	That is so terrible."
"I was doing the dishes and a huge roach crawled out from underneath the dishwasher.	Oh god. Did it get you?"
"I almost fell over trying to crush it, i forgot I wasn't wearing shoes and stepped on in with my bare feet.	That roach must have been terrifying for you. Did you get any funny looks?"
"I was walking down the street at night, I felt like I was surrounded by something unseen.	Woowoo... What was it?!"
"Every time I turned around to try and catch something there was nothng there. Just the feeling of something watching me....	Oh my, that sounds terrifying!  What did you do?  What was it?"
"I had a job interview that I didn't really feel prepared for.	How did it go after you arrived at the interview place?"
"I did not get it unfortunately.	That's a shame. Do you think you'll be let down next time?"
"One time, I smelled an odd burning smell coming from under the hood of my car.	Oh, man! I bet that was scary. What did you do?"
"Well, when I went to lift the engine cover, I noticed a dead, rotting squirrel on top of the engine block! It was so repulsive.	Yikes that's gross. I would have freaked out."
"I went to the store, just trying to get some milk and bread, and I got rear ended by a driver.	oh no! that's horrible! did he/she stop and help you? did you get anything else?"
"Yeah, it was more of a shock than anything, was not expecting someone to hit you when you are just crossing the street.	Oh no! That's terrible! Was anyone hurt?"
"I have been working and prepping a powerful and moving speech.	Oh, that's fun! Are you worried at all about how you'll perform in front of a large amount of people?"
"I can only dream. No it's more on par with Lord of the RIng's final battle.	Wow, that's a pretty epic scene! How long do you think you have to speak for?"
"Someone let me cut in line at the store so I could check out faster.	Did you say something or were you just excited?"
"Yeah, I was in a huge hurry and didn't have much but I really needed to make it to the bank before it closed.	Oh wow, that's very unfortunate. I wonder why that person did that?"
"I thought I bombed my math test but I got a 103 on it.	103 what? I don't understand you."
"I reviewed all the homework and the test questions mostly had the same problems on them. I didn't feel like I understood how to do the problems but I remembered the answers.	103 is awesome! You must have been so happy and proud of yourself!"
"I just found a photo book of me and my family growing up.	Thats so sweet. How old were they then/"
"It was pretty nostalgic , how young we all looked growing up.	I do love looking at my old photo albums too"
"I finally got to see a baseball game live this last week.	how was it?"
"It was the Rockies, no home-run though, it was pretty high up there I felt like I could see the world.	how was it?"
"When my buddy asked me to help him clean out his grandmother's house who had recently passed, I was not prepared for what we found.	What did find?"
"You hit it right on the money. She was not only a hoarder but a cat lady, and the mix of paper, bugs and cat feces was an affront to the senses.	Holy cow, that must've taken some preparation! Glad to hear it turned out well."
"I let my dad borrow my car and he got in a minor accident.	Oh no, how are you fixing your car!?"
"Yeah he is fine and my car was not damaged. My insurance premium is probably going to go up though.	That is not minor accident if you ask me."
"He said he would cover the extra costs so I'm not too upset	When I bought my new car, I couldn't believe how smooth the ride was.	That is awesome.  What kind of car did you get"
"It's a Chevrolet Camaro.	oh nice, you must have got it used, the salesman tried insisting i needed an auto reconnection"
"I studied for 7 months to take the GRE exam, it was stressful.	I hope you did well on it!"
"I did, and I was accepted to my number 1 program, which meant that I was going to be paid to learn!	That is such an incredible feat! What school did you pick?"
"I have a feeling the really hard work might just be beginning, but I feel exceptionally lucky.	I studied all night for my final exams. I needed to pass them to graduate from college.	How do you feel now after all that study? are you satisfied with the results?"
"I did. I was able to sneak in a few hours here and there.	I love sneaking in free time to read good books."
"I left my wallet in a movie theater, and didn't notice till I was half way home!	That sounds super scary, what happened after?"
"I was able to get back in and find it, it was pretty well hidden in between the seats. No harm no foul.	That's good. Sometimes people leave things out on purpose."
"Some people are just so generous. Really makes you feel like there is some humanity left out there.	I agree! generous are people like that."
"That's incredible if true, but I have trouble believing you for some reason. I was talking about some stranger who gave my friend 3 free tickets to a rock concert - we had such a blast!	I would do anything for my friend too, I just cant understand how people can treat people so poorly"
"I was so proud of my daughter over the weekend.	What did you get accomplished that weekend?"
"She performed her first solo dance in competition, but she had been in leg braces for the last 2 years.	That is great, she must have a partner in crime."
"It was, very much so, I will cherish it forever.	I'm grateful for the work hours, but bummed that I can't get time off.	yea i know that feel"
"Well, I've worked without a break for the last 3 years, I just want to get away abit.	That's too bad but, also maybe too late now."
"Right! I'd like to go lay on a beach, or even just the next town over at this point.	I have been extremely diligent in my studies so far, and am participating in two clubs this upcoming year. The future is looking bright!	what clubs? are you going to be a member?"
"I am an electrical engineering student, and I am interested in quite a few things at this point. I think after this year, I will be able to get a paid internship next summer!	That is great! I hope that you get that internship! Good luck!"
"I am so tired of hauling garbage to the county dump.	Ugh that is so stressful and it only takes you 15 minutes to jog to the dumpster from your car."
"The company in my city just quit picking up for any of the residents, so the dump has a line every day.	That is horrible! Pick ups are so annoying!"
"We have, and we called a city meeting. I'm just beyond words,it has to be corrected.	's all too common these days. |||| NEW CONVERSATION ||| I recently went to a dinner where we were served something unconventional to say the least.	What was the thing?"
"I should have known better, as these friends are on the ""crunchier side"". They had a loaf of bread that they made with flour that had cockroaches added to it!	Yuck! Sounds gross! What did you do?"
"I lost my appetite completely! I will be sure to get takeout before hand if we ever go to another one of their dinners.	my mom is supposed to call me regarding her test results.	Did she?"
"She had stage 3 cancer, but she was clear last screening a year ago.	That's pretty lucky. Is it still too early to tell if she's going to be alive or not?"
"Thank you, I have a good feeling about it.	I went to a wedding recently, and something happened that put a damper on it. I felt bad for my buddy, but at least he knows he can trust me.	I'm sorry you felt that way. Was it something that he could do anything in response to?"
"Yeah, his wife got drunk and paid a pass at me. I told her to sober up, and let him know what had happened.	Oh wow that's unfortunate. Yeah wedding venues can get pretty relaxed!"
"I am highly upset that I'm the only one concerned with earning money for our bills	I am also concerned about this. Are you in a career field that requires income, or do you just work at home most often?"
"Not much. It's all on me. It sucks	That's so sad, how much are you making?"
"I love playing old school video games. The music is amazing	I used to play a ton of video games when I was little."
"For me it's happy emotions	I agree! I played DOOM last year and had a blast! It's an amazing game. Did you play it recently on the Switch?"
"The micro brewery explosion in America has been awesome for my girlfriend and I, as we love craft beer. Until recently, our town didn't have one though.	I haven't heard about the explosion. How big was it?"
"We actually don't brew our own, and hadn't been able to try many because we live in a small town. But we just got the news that a micro brewery was opening here in a few weeks!	What is a micro brewery?"
"I hate it when other guys look at my girl	Do they do things to you?"
"She's for my eyes only. At least she doesn't pay them any attention. Or I would flip!	I feel you there! I look at guys and girls side by side all the time."
"Everyone I have ever worked with in a kitchen has either already read ""Kitchen Confidential"", or I have made them read it. We were all devastated when Anthony Bourdain passed away earlier this year.	It's so sad. It's a shame that he passed away..."
"He started from the bottom and worked his way up. He had a passion for people as well as food, and we all still look up to him.	Awww, I'm sorry for your loss.  Anthony Bourdain was a great man.  I'm glad that some people still care about him."
"My husband and friends planned me a baby shower without me knowing.	That was nice of them!"
"Yes, it was a lot of fun and it caught me off guard. It meant a lot that they did it for me.	Aww that's sweet! How many people were in the area? Did you have fun at least?"
"I gave twin fawns in our yard some fresh peaches and they loved them.	Fresh peaches bring back the nostalgia of winter wonderland visits!"
"I enjoy helping the wildlife in our area. It is alway a good feeling to give a helping hand.	That's so nice! What kind of fauna does the twin grow?"
"In a week my wife will finally be back from being out of the country for 2 months!	That's awesome! Where will you be going?"
"She was taking a language course in Germany for her graduate studies.	That's awesome!  Are you excited to be with your wife again?"
"I'm moving into another apartment and just told my neighbor I was leaving. He said he was sorry I'm going!	oh thats good of your neighbor! i would be sad if i was in your situation"
"About a year and a half. I really didn't expect him to say that - we don't know each other that well.	thats cool. i moved out of my old apartment into a new one and have friends in all different states. it's so nice living with people you actually know"
"Very true. I do pet his dog when I see them. Perhaps he recognizes a fellow dog-lover!	Ugh...my boss made me stay late yesterday, so I had to work overtime, but I didn't even get paid for it!	That's the worst.  You'd think they would be more considerate to your time"
"I'm technically salaried, so I don't get paid overtime. It's still really irritating.	I would be so mad!  Did he tell you about it?"
"I went to my car one morning and found that some kids in my condo complex had thrown food all over it	Oh no that's terrible! I hope it was just some kids."
"Sadly, no.  There's no actual proof of who it was, but we've seen them doing random stuff like that all over the place.  He did have the cops called on him for unrelated things once, so I'll take that as a victory.	Well at least he didn't get into a shooting. That's something"
"My husband went to a job fair and got a lot of job offers!	Nice did he take any of them?"
"He is currently Active Duty Army, but is wanting to go into transportation/logistics.	oh wow that sounds really cool, transportation seems interesting"
"It's been a great day so far! The sun is out and I'm on my second cup of coffee!	Good for you. What are you getting up too?!"
"Yes I am, about to make some soup for lunch. This day has been just what I needed!	Aww, what kind of soup are you going to make?"
"When I applied for the job I have now it took them like a month to get back to me with a final answer.  It was pretty stressful.	Oh wow! That must have been very annoying! I would have been super busy!"
"Super frustrating.  It worked out in the end, but I had to bug them a few times to make sure they hadn't abandoned me.	That sounds very annoying!  Were they helpful at least when you tried to talk to them?"
"A friend of mine took early retirement recently and he and his wife are traveling all over the world.	That's cool! I hope you guys enjoy it! I hope you two become a couple. :)"
"I know - I wish I could do that. They've been to France, Italy, Croatia and Chile so far - I'm sitting in NC!	Wow. That's awesome!  You must be so proud."
"I would just like to be able to drive to Raleigh without hurting! I fell and broke my hip a while back and can't walk properly.	Wow, you're in luck then. You can just buy a car and drive around! That's actually not that crazy difficult."
"One more operation and I should be good. In the meantime, I have to live vicariously through Joe and Helen :)	My wife has been out of the country for 2 months, she gets back in a week.  I can't wait!	Where has she gone?"
"I really did.  It'll be great to have her back :)	I hope she is well fed and comfortable."
"When I interviewed for the job I have now, they didn't give me a solid answer for like a month after the interview.	That must have stung!  You've given me hope though!  You must have prepared yourself well for the interview!"
"It worked out ok, but I had to keep bugging them to make sure they hadn't given up on me.	That must have been very annoying. I hope you didn't get any other interviews."
"My wife has been out of the country for the last 2 months for school.	Oh, that must be hard. I'm sorry."
"I do.  She's getting back soon, but it's been tough being along with the dogs every night.	Aww, I love animals, I would totally hate it"
"When I interviewed for my current job, I felt like it went well but all I could do was wait.	I bet you were ready to wait. Did you get the job offer?"
"A lab technician at a university.	I could never do that.  I would have to think very long on some of the questions they asked."
"My parents brought my brother a brand new iPhone. He always gets the newest stuff and I get stuck with nothing.	That must make you mad! Can you return it?"
"I have no idea. He's the ""golden child."" It's super unfair.	That's really unfair. I would complain to your parents"
"My wife has been out of the country for two months, which is really hard when one of us is having a bad day and we can't help the other.	Oh that's a bummer!  How are you holding up?  What are you both doing to try and keep it together?"
"She gets back in a week, so it's almost over.	Awe, that's too bad. I hope she comes back with good news soon!"
"my husband opened the door and a huge wasp flew in! I hate insects. they are so nasty	Aww that would tickle me but it's so cute! What did you do about it?"
"heck yes i did! I locked myself in the room and told him he needs to kill that thing before he goes to work	Oh god, an wasp? I would have been so terrified!"
"i hate all the mosquitos that grow during the rain season	I do not like the mosquitos either"
"yes i hate going out when it is rainny season there is so many of them	I live in the south and they are so much worse here. Mosquitos are the worst."
"Both me and my girlfriend are super scared of spiders, but she made me kill a huge one yesterday.	Wow! How'd it get there?"
"Exactly!!!! Isn't that enough to fear them?!	Oh my gosh! You must have done something horrible to deserve such fear."
"I'm going skydiving for the first time with some friends!	Nice, I've always wanted to do an experience similar to that of the movie their movie edge of Darkness"
"A little bit, but I love doing extreme stuff like this.	Oh wow! that sounds like so much fun!!!"
"The othern ight I was having tea outside and forgot my glass outside all night!	Oh no!  That happens to the best of us. Did it make you sleepy?"
"It was gross though when I went to go and get it! It was all full of bugs!	Oh gross!"
"On my last visit to my orthopedic surgeon he suggested surgery to fix my hip.	I hope it goes well. How old is your hip now?"
"Nervous. Surgery is a big step and I'm afraid something will go wrong.	Oh no, I hope you can get it all done!"
"You're absolutely correct and the hospital's one of the best in the country. Still, I fret about it. I should just get on with it!	I'm about to go overseas and i was so overwhelmed with packing and getting ready and my friend came over and helped me to pack	Where are you going?"
"she is wonderful! She helped me out so many times i don't know what i would do withiut her	That's awesome that your friend helped you out."
"Cell phones are great, but sometimes they can cause situations that are uncomfortable.	What situations do you mean?"
"Usually they just interupt with a ring. But Youtube is on my lock screen and it played out loud while I was inline, and it was not an appropriate topic!	Oh no! I have had that happen, it really is an uncomfortable situation"
"Of course they did, some guy in this video was dropping the f bomb out of no where. I was humiliated,lol.	My dog died today :(	I'm sorry to hear that :( Are you going to get another one?"
"Yes, she had cancer so we knew she was going to pass soon. My daughter won't stop crying.	I'm so sorry. How long did you have her for?"
"my daughter went on vacation with her friends and the house feels so lonely	I'm sorry to hear that. Where did they vacation at?"
"they went to the beach for 1 week	Aww that's too bad. Maybe you should get a dog?"
"I'm moving to a new apartment in a few weeks and can't wait! No more obnoxious upstairs neighbors!	Congrats! I bet your excited and full of joy right now!"
"Stomp around at all times of the day and night, screeching into their cellphones and playing loud video games. What do yours do?	Ugh, I am the same! It's so quiet and spacy up there."
"Eww. Yes, it is loud. Who would live in an upstairs apartment with a small child? That's nuts!	My wife has been out of the country for two months, and is coming back in a week!	Oh, well that's no good! How long will she be away?"
"It sure is.  It's just been me and the dogs all summer, I've gotten super bored :P	Aww, where did she go? I hope she hasn't had too many adventures!"
"I hope you do too! Applying is a huge step in the right direction!	Thank you, I'm crossing my fingers!"
"I had such a huge spider ran past me in the bathroom. I am so grossed out by all the bugs here!	Oh no I'm so sorry! I hope everything is okay now (don't freak out too much)"
"Spiders could bite me, which could really hurt!	i feel that with my training lately im going to win my next week soccer game	Hey that's awesome!  I bet you're a great player!"
"for this specific game for about 3 months	That's awesome!  What is the game for?"
"After my wife and I moved I went through a while of unemployment.  It was really tough not being able to support us.	I know that pain, my brother-in-law went through it too when he came to Chicago in 2009/10.  It's definitely not an easy thing to do."
"It's gotten better now, but it could still get even better.  Just got to keep on moving.	That's good that things are on your path.  I am in a similar situation right now."
"i am really happy for next year i have a trip planned to go to india	I am happy for you! Where is the trip to?"
"yeah i have been planning this trip for over 2 years	That's awesome. Are you going to visit anyone or just yourself?"
"I had the most wonderful week recently. My neighbors weren't here and I could do whatever I wanted without them stomping on my head!	That sounds wonderful. What was it that happened?"
"It was. I can't even brush my teeth at 8am without one or the other of them thumping around upstairs.	That would make me mad!  I would just laugh and keep walking.  You are so lucky."
"That blessed week was so peaceful and calming. Everything felt right in my world. Then they came back!	I'm glad you had a blessed week. It's so quiet now since they came back and you don't hear much anymore."
"Getting a new apartment soon. At least the new neighbors will hopefully be at work during the day.	That's nice that they are trying to make things more interesting."
"I went to work with my pants inside out, and I didn't notice until my secretary pointed it out.	That's hilarious. I would have noticed."
"It was very embarrassing! At least I didn't go the whole day like that.	Oh no! I hope that you didn't have to stay in that room that long!"
"The airport was completely empty the other day.	Why empty the airport?"
"Home, but I thought LA would be crowded even at 4am, it made the hair on my arms stand up it was so creepy.	I would imagine, that would be very scary indeed!"
"Made getting my connection super easy, and trust me I was in a hurry to get there. Odd how being alone can make you paranoid.	i cant wait to see my dog back home it has been 2 years since i see him	That's so exciting! I have two dogs myself. They're quite the handful!"
"college, but i will be seeing him very soon i think	That's good! What type of breed is it?"
"So my youngest went to his first day of kindergarten today.  So proud of him.  Silly I know.	How many children do you have"
"I hope so should be home really soon.  Can't wait to hear all about it.  IT goes by to fast!	Faster, hu/"
"I know my oldest just graduated,  It was like it was over in an instant!	A few months ago we were planning our wedding and I couldn't wait until the actual day finally arrived.	What happened that made you so excited about the wedding?"
"It was even better then expected. It was very small, but so happy how it turned out.	What color was your wedding?"
"i hate when my neighboors dog poops on my yard and she does nothing, i dont care if he poops if she picks it up	That is terrible. I don't understand why people can't have nice things, let alone dogs."
"hahaha i mean he does not do it often but it is not a bad idea	You don't have dogs in your neighborhood? What are you even talking about? Do you have a pit bull? Haha I'm sorry I didn't make that connection..."
"After studying and preaching for a few years, my husband was ordained to be a minister.	Congrats! That's an awesome achievement!"
"Yes it is and he is so devoted to God and living for Him. I was so happy for him.	That's so awesome! What is he doing to minister?"
"Thank you.	This morning, my dog knocked down a while box of cereal and it spilled everywhere.	That sucks!  Did you have the box all clean??"
"Yes, and to make it worse, when I tried to clean it, she tried to eat, so she almost knocked me over too. I was not happy.	That is so annoying. Did you kick she to the curb and give her a piece of that?"
"No, she only ate a little bit. I cleaned it up pretty quickly.	There was a new resturaunt that opened up around the corner and everyone was raving about it	That's always fun! What kind of restaurant?"
"I did! It was terrible! I was so upset! It was expensive, small, and bland!	I hate when a restauraunt is so cheap.  I'm glad you were brave enough to try it out!"
"In my last job most of my co-workers had different beliefs to me. It was a little awkward at times.	I can imagine. Co-workers can sometimes have different ideas on how to run an organization."
"If things got a bit much I'd excuse myself and go elsewhere. I didn't want to get into an argument, but wasn't going to compromise my own beliefs by lying.	Sometimes when you're in a heated argument you might want to just end it and move on."
"I became quite good at that - the great vanishing employee, lol. I'm all for earnest discussion, but not at work!	My husband had to repair something and we bought a ton of lumber. He was able to carry so much at once!	Oh wow! I can carry a ton of luggage too! It's not easy!"
"He is! I was so shocked but super attracted to him too!	That sounds like it would be a challenge. I carry way more lumber than I need too."
"i was really sad when my dog died last year	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. How did he die?"
"yeah i have been over it for sometime now but it is till hard to talk about	Oh no. I lost my cat recently too. It's never good news."
"A good friend was supposed to visit me this Summer, but he got a job and had to cancel.	Oh no, I'm sorry, are you guys really close?"
"Yeah, and it's one he really wanted and enjoys. I'm really happy for him, but would have really liked to see him.	That sucks but I guess everyone fumbles in life. It'll work itself out."
"I hope so. We always have such a good time and like a lot of the same things. Oh well, some other time.	My husband's grandmother and I were very close. We hung out and talked everyday. One Friday, we went to breakfast and she told me that her and her husband were going on vacation the next day. She was so excited. The next morning I called her after they had left and told her to be safe, have fun, and that I loved her. She told me she loved me too. The morning after that phone call, we found out that she had a heart attack and died.	That's terrible, i'm really sorry."
"Yes, it hit our whole family very hard. That was in 2013, and sometimes I still pick up the phone to call her and tell her something.	I'm so sorry. That must have been devastating."
"Thank you.	My cat went missing 3 days ago. I found her.	Oh, how sweet!  What is she up to?  Did you find her?"
"I found her on the side of the street with her guts hanging in the gutter. I was so upset and sad	I'm so glad you found her. You must be so relieved and relieved to find out she's still alive."
"I love to play golf, but injured my hip a while back. I really want to play again.	I'm sure with a good arch you can get it up again, what hurt you"
"It sure is! Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you, too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again!	I'm glad it worked out for you and I hope to play golf some time in the future!"
"Just the thought of getting back on the golf course is enough to get me off the couch, lol.	Skydiving is an exillirating and scary experience!	I agree! Do you do it yourself?"
"I did not for many years, but my brother convinced me to tandem with him to celebrate our mothers remission.	That sounds like a challenging experience!"
"I think when my children are grown that I might, I would need to feel secure with the abilities of those in charge. You are putting your life in their hands.	I bought a new tv. The colors are so vibrant and it is so sharp!	Nice. What provider did you buy?"
"I am, I have been watching all my favorite movies.	That's cool. What kind of tv is it?"
"I am, I think my wife is getting tired of all the time I am spending watching movies.	I woke up needing to use the bathroom at midnight. As soon as I sit down a giant bug flew into my face!	A giant flying bug? How terrifying! What did you do?"
"I screamed so loud that I woke up my husband and he though we were being burgled!	That is so funny! I would have totally been in your shoes! I hate bugs sooooo much!"
"I have this very serious interview tomorrow and I'm so nervous. I know what to say but i'm scared i will forget everything	donate your memorabilia"
"a government position. Can't really say much. :) but I really hope i will get this job, they pay really good money	You will do fine, just stay calm and do your thing."
"I had a dream the other night about my friends from high school. It brought back all kinds of memories from my teen years and thinking back made me smile.	Nice! Was it a real life friend that you were talking about or was this a dream? Either way, great!"
"I told my husband. The dream made me miss my best friend from high school.	Sounds like a fun dream. Did you ever find out what happened to him after that or is he still around?"
"I actually sent her a message through facebook.	That's nice. Were you able to catch up with them?"
"I guess that's a good word for it.	I came home from work today and my wife had a new puppy waiting for me.	Oh man! I have one and they are the cutest dogs ever. Was she happy to surprise you?"
"Yeah, he is such a cutie. I have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day.	That's awesome! I love animals! What kind of puppy did you get?"
"It is, a day I will always remember. I named him spot, because he has a funny looking spot on his back.	I saved up the money to buy a certain dress that I had been wanting for a while. When I finally got the money saved, it was sold out everywhere, except Ebay. The problem was, the price was doubled.	That's such a shame. You would think they would have a system like that to prevent that!"
"I may buy it still, but I have to save up more money now.	That sucks, I hate when things like that happen! Have you looked up the designer before, to make sure they're legit?"
"I hope so. I as so exited to be able to get it.	I bought a load of German chocolate bars in Aldi. I then ate too many of them. I shouldn't have done that - no self-control!	oh my gosh i feel you! I have done that loads! My son used to eat loads of salted chocolate bars"
"It was sheer greed, I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments, but I really shouldn't have done that.	That seems extreme but maybe you can explain it to yourself over the chocolate."
"It certainly was - German chocolate is delicious!	my son is sick, he got this hand foot and mouth desease, nothing serious but he has a fever	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that!  I hope he feels better asap!"
"i know, i got some motrin, funny movies and lots of cuddles.i hope he will feel better tomorrow	Oh no! Is he feeling better now that you're here?"
"i used to be a member of a cool dance crew. we had so much fun together. we used to battle other teams and win local competitions	Cool! What kind of competitions"
"honestly, no, it's been 8 years haha loooong time ago! I wish i could hang out with all those people again	I know what you mean, it's hard to find people to hang out with these days especially at college!"
"I'm getting really psyched about the upcoming Ryder Cup golf tournament. I've been watching it since I was a kid.	I have never golfed, is it like that?"
"I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that, if you don't play, it would be pretty boring!	Nice, maybe I can get some time on this app to play."
"I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.	Last Christmas Eve, after a family event, I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room. At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him, and it had hurt her feelings.	Oh no, how awful! Did she say something to the police?"
"Yes, I was able to make her feel better, and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out, and I was ready to confront some people.	That is so sweet! Did daddy bear side bear your mama?"
"Yes, they did.	I was cleaning up my garden bed when I found a bunch of bones in it!	oh no. what did you do with the rest of the bones?"
"I called the cops! Turns out that it's bird bones! My cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden!	That's too bad. Did the cops come?"
"I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals!	I would too, if i was in his position"
"They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!	I would sentence them to community service"
"More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.	Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I.	I bet it did.. did you find out what it was?"
"It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in.	Oh my goodness, that must have been so terrifying! I'm glad you found your wife and were okay!"
"It would be, I worry for the safety of my family.	My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.	What a good friend! lend me your undivided attention and strength my friend!"
"They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.	That is good to hear, how much did you borrow?"
"Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.	My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first	How'd he do that? I'd like a blindfold myself!"
"He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too!	Wow, that's pretty crazy! What a nice man!"
"Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.	Yes I saw one fly a few days before I moved. It freaks me out"
"Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?	Oh wow. You think a person could just walk up to it and kill it with a RPG or something?"
"i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes	I completely understand. It can really be annoying at times!"
"like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat	That sounds really childish of her."
"It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.	That's sad to hear. Are you going to get another one?"
"Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.	thats really sad to here, my friend who had a dog also passes away, it is very sad"
"A border collie, he was a great doggie.	My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.	Oh that's terrible! I hope that he is going to be okay."
"She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.	That's scary, my son is also at risk and could be getting checked out."
"I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.	oh my goodness. you should sue the hotel"
"I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay, but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.	Wow, I am sorry to hear that.  I am sure the truck smelled bad too!"
"I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.	I would have done that as well.  What happened to yours?"
"I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.	That's good you had a good idea on how to protect yourself."
"I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!	I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.	I know that must be quite hard, but I believe you will do well.  What do you do?"
"Thank you, I have been compiling  data for 5 years, my brain is totally absorbed by it.	Wow, that's a lot of extra work! What are you getting a degree in?"
"Criminal and social justice.	I just froze when It was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world.	Haha I bet you were a little shocked"
"I think it was just the thought of being so high up.	Hahaha! Did the thrill finally overcome you?"
"I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.	That sucks. You're a hard worker, you should work as hard as you possibly can."
"Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.	Well you could always watch tv or play games. Or you could meet some new people. What do you usually do?"
"In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.	I absolutely agree.  They're like family members you know?"
"Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.	Oh wow. I'm really sorry for your loss. I had a dog that was the same way."
"Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.	A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.	Did it go over well at all?"
"Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!	That sounds amazing!  How far did it get?"
"When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped.	Wow, that's terrible. I wonder what they thought?"
"She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade	I'm happy that she is doing better now though. Hopefully it continues"
"I finally had a day of, but the weather was terrible and rainy and cold.	Rain is good sometimes!"
"I was hoping to get a chance to play outside and get some sun.	I'm in the exact same situation! Finally a day off where I can get some sun and play outside? I'd love that."
"I just got back from a latenight showing of the horror movie insidious	Sounds like fun!  What did you see?"
"Not really I  almost had an accident at some of the startling points.	What happened? Did people actually get into the movie?"
"I have been looking around at different car insurance quotes	How do you feel about that? Are things good or bad for you?"
"a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is	Yea, compared to what I pay, insurance is really not that expensive in my opinion. compared to my neighbors, it is ridiculous"
"I just ate a whole cake by myself, I feel sick!	I don't blame you, that sounds like an amazing accomplishment in itself!"
"Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house.	Oh wow. Maybe have someone take a bite!"
"The other night I had a panic attack out the blue	Oh no! What happened?"
"Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about.	That is terrible, I hope you recover."
"I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.	Oh no! Did you miss him and you have any pets?"
"We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.	Oh man, I'm so sorry! I hope your dog is found safe!"
"We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there.	I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing.	I'm so sorry to hear about that, that must be so awful."
"That's just it. We didn't really ""break up"" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.	That really sucks man. I am so sorry."
"Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight.	That's a nice thing to do.  I wish I could pay for things too!"
"I will, you never know when someone else is in need!	That is so nice! Did you have a Starbucks?"
"It is, I have been so blessed in my life!	My husband started college this week!	Oh wow that's awesome!  I bet he is excited.  I know mine are."
"Yes, he is still active duty army but getting out in November. I am so proud of him furthering his education!	Oh wow, what is he in college for?"
"I am a really picky eater, and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me.	Oh no. Can you go back to the place?"
"No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it.	Yikes!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  Did they at least offer you a replacement?"
"So gross, that is certain.	I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air	Oh no!  Did you hurt your self?"
"I thankfully didn't burn myself bad but I spilled it all over myself! I was so shy afterwards	Ouch!  I've been there before!  Did you trip over anything?"
"Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid, I was really frightened the other night.	Why scary movies?"
"I went for a drink downstairs, and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night,lol.	Was the movie good?"
"I really was, and I'm supposed to be the grown up, but I got my daughter to lie next to me.	My neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep!	That must be annoying. Dogs can get rowdy when their excited about something!"
"People walking on the bike trail behind our house. It's a daily thing, it gets so annoying!	Have you called the police on them yet?"
"I just got done eating an entire pizza by myself.	Did that make you feel yucky?"
"I feel so full and fat and happy. I can't wait to do it again.	Wow that's a crazy good appetite! How much pizza was it?"
"When I got my first paycheck with a bonus, I knew I didn't need to worry anymore about my expenses. It was quite the feeling!	It is such an amazing feeling, wasn't it?"
"Yes exactly! I was able to finally start saving for retirement. I'd been procrastinating somewhat, so it really was a relief, like you said.	That's great. I'm glad you got that feeling. Procrastination can really relieve stress."
"Tomorrow I start my new job teaching kids. I really hope it goes well!	What kind of job is it?"
"I am teaching at a small private school, so I will be teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade. I am pretty excited, just nervous.	Wow that sounds really exciting! Good luck and I'm sure it will go great!"
"It really is, you are molding their future!	I just lost my dog. My ex got him in the divorce	That's so sad. Have you been crying yourself to sleep at night?"
"No we are not on speaking terms, It's pretty unfair, thankfully we didn't have a kid together.	That's sad to hear, I'm sorry to hear. I hope things get better for you two in the future."
"Getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle.	I agree. Do you have a new debit card issued to you?"
"They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.	That sucks. I don't think autopay is an issue with visa or American Express."
"It is, to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.	My sister got a promotion at work last week!	Oh wow! I am so happy for her! Is she getting a big raise?"
"She is an accountant for a college in Alaska. She's been working their for years so I'm glad they saw her dedication :)	She must have a fulfilling career ahead!"
"My friend wrote a creative writing piece that I helped edit, and it won her a scholarship. I was so proud, like a dad, even though we're roughly the same age.	That's awesome! I bet she was happy!"
"Yeah it was! I joke with her that I should get a portion of the money since I told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it. She wasn't originally going to.	That was very thoughtful of you. I bet she really enjoyed the writing piece and the winnings."
"My eldest son is off and is starting his first year in college.  Im so nervous for him!	Oh I bet, I can relate! I'm 35 and about to enter my first year as well! Time flies! What is he studying?"
"I think it's more stressful for me than it is for him!  I just want the best for him, just not used to not being there with him.	I can imagine, being a parent can be an adjustment"
"Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?	Yes def, but I think you are right, at some point you just have to let go."
"Cant wait to see what he can do,  Its exciting too!	Yes that's the crazy part.  You don't know what he might do or how he might react, that's the exciting part!  It's like you're putting a mine in mine and hoping they mine it."
"I have trouble remembering a time I was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when I got the Nintendo 64 for Christmas all those years ago.	64? Why?"
"It sure is now, but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.	Hah, I bet you felt incredibly happy when it came out, too!"
"I need a B average to stay in my major and I'm struggling in a course.	I'm sure you have it. Just stay positive. You need as many friends as possible to help."
"I found a study group, I didn't flunk the class. But I made an 84 on my physics test and need an 86.	I'm glad you passed!"
"Hopefully, I don't even understand how others get all A's.	I came home from work today and my husband had dinner already made!	That sounds nice! What did he have?"
"Haha my husband plays video games as well, but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.	What did he make"
"Let me tell you something. Always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters. Few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!	That is a good point!  Coffee filters can be a pain to deal with."
"Not only did I have a rough morning because of it, but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.	I can just imagine.  Coffee filters are the most convenient convenience I've ever bought for any hobby.  And to think it was my first accident... ouch.  I'm sorry to hear you had such an inconvenient experience."
"4	What about 4?"
"Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon, they carry something in their nails/claws.	Oh wow. Do they eat alot?"
"My son wanted one of those once, but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one,lol.	I got canned from my job and I'm feeling pretty good these days because I have more work than I can handle without needing to go to an office everyday	OH no! I hate when that happened! Did you have another job lined up for?"
"Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts, good thing I'm not allergic	That's good, I am allergic but I don't think it's that bad."
"I was laying in bed last night when I realized just how happy I am	I bet that made you very jittery"
"Nope! I just realized how happy and content I am with my life!	OH! happiness is something that is hard to come by."
"I had such a bad cold last week, I was coughing up a lot of nasty stuff into cups just so that it wouldn't hurt when I swallowed.	did you drink enough water to keep it inside?"
"No, thankfully my symptoms weren't anything that couldn't be managed with a stiff mimosa or seven. But still, I had to throw those cups out. Yuck.	That's terrible, what can you do to help manage it now that it's better"
"No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it, my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!	Did she get mad?"
"I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.	Lactose intolerant people are the most annoying.  I am one of those!  I'm glad you were happy with it!  You should have eaten it! hahah"
"She probably did, during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am, drunk, with some random guy she brought home from the club.	Lactose intolerant? I'm sorry to hear that. Are you thinking about getting some milk or something to help?"
"Either he ate it, or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it, and I'm about to hulk out!	I am so not ready for this baby. The wife is due next week, and I'm really uncertain that I'm gonna be a good dad or that we'll have enough to provide for her.	What are the big questions that will be asked then?  I think you have plenty of time."
"I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books, and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.	Oh no. I hope you are prepared! It's so exciting though when your kids grow up! I am sure everything goes well for you."
"I was walking and say a cat in front of me wagging its tail on the sidewalk and thought it was awesome	haha I've done that before! What did you do after?"
"I attacked it with some pets, it was an outside cat which don't get angry too much I'm guessing	Oh, outside cats are rarely angry!"
"I'm taking my midterm exam this week, and I really want to do well on it. I've studied a lot, and taken the practice test 5 times. I'm still pretty anxious though!	That's a bummer. You should do better than you think!"
"That's true. I probably have it down pat at this point. It's just it's my first graduate course, and I want to ace my entire graduate degree with a 4.0 GPA. This is my first major major grade.	That's impressive! I'm sure you'll do well."
"I was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex-girlfriend didn't get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before I moved. Really made me miss her, seeing all that stuff.	Oh man I hate it when that happens...I had that happen with a few girls I was involved with. Hopefully you can get her stuff back"
"Well, I spent some time remembering the good times. Then I reminded myself that we broke up for a reason, and we'd moved on. Had to process all the way through it, you know?	I can imagine. I hope it wasn't for the worst."
"Polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call.	Yes, they are supposed to. That does make the phone call annoying though, no pun intended."
"I threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!	That must of been scary!"
"I understand, but coming at me head on, on a two lane highway, while I'm on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool.	Especially when you are not even in the US"
"Uh oh, did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.	That is awful!  I would be furious!"
"2	I saw a scorpion in my house yesterday and still haven't found it!	How scary! Do you live on a farm?"
"Yes, im scared to sleep! It ran under couch last time I saw it.	I would be terrified! I would run too!"
"I am constantly amazed by my sister's art skills. I'm not sure where she got them...my brother and I can't draw to save our lives.	That is really nice to hear, I am the same with my sister's art."
"Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young, so she has a way to go, but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.	That's pretty great!  You must be really good at it!"
"I used to worry that I would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if I had problems, but my best friend Kayla has proved otherwise.	That is so nice! How long have you been friends?"
"I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life, and she's always been supportive.	That's great to hear! I am glad you have a great friend!"
"I have some bad news, unfortunately. Well, bad for me. I was diagnosed with lung cancer.	I am so sorry, that must be terrible.  How are you feeling?"
"It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health, and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.	Oh, I""m sorry. I just have some bad news too. I just lost my sister to cancer. She was a very lovely woman."
"Thank you so much for being supportive. :)	I heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night. I think it was 2 or 3 in the morning.	Did you call the police?"
"Not a chance! I was too scared to go out, and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.	That is crazy! I'm glad it wasn't something serious though."
"Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that, no way jose.	I really didn't know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend.	Did you have family over? How old was your dad when you got the surgery"
"Seems to have, yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year, but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.	That's awesome. I hope he recovers well!"
"Yes, hopefully he does, because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely, not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.	I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...	Oh my goodness! I'm so sorry!"
"I might look into that, thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore, it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids, is a big one.	If they're smart, the age old question of can you have kids is going to be answered, and you definitely should if they want good life. But for now, it's probably not something you can do. You're a good person for getting the news though!"
"Playing old video games reminds of the summers where my friends and I would hang out endlessly	I hear you! I love playing video games. What kind of games do you play?"
"Super smash bros is a classic, never gets old, but yeah you're right	Yeah, I remember playing with my friends from time to time. It's always fun reminiscing about the good ol' days. It's like those games weren't just games, they were like real life friendships."
"I had a job interview recently	How do you feel about that"
"Not well. I didn't really feel prepared for it.	Don't be too hard on yourself. I'm sure you did fine."
"Speaking of co-workers, one of my colleagues just found the cure for type 2 diabetes, and I honestly couldn't be more annoyed about it.	I'm so sorry! That's an awful disease and I hope that your co-worker is okay!"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing and all, but it was supposed to be MY discovery. I wanted that Nobel Prize and the trip to Stockholm. Now I don't think my dad will ever think I've accomplished anything.	I'm really sorry. Type 2 diabetes is horrible and is very treatable if you work hard and are on a healthy diet. It's a life changer."
"I went to a movie alone recently because none of my friends wanted to go with me	Oh no that sounds lonely! Why were they not wanting to go with you?"
"Jurassic World. It was okay.	That sounds lonely!  Did you enjoy it>"
"I just bought iced coffee yesterday and my brother drank the rest of it without asking me.	hahahaha that's funny.  Did he do something to make him feel bad?"
"Yeah, he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge.	lol sounds like a win win situation!  Did you buy anything nice with it?"
"I thought it was unfair how YouTube banned Alex Jones	Really? I didn't hear about that."
"I think people are just getting riled up for the midterms	Oh yeah, he's a pretty bad guy, I can't stand his movies."
"I was playing hide n seek when I was a kid and I had to use the restroom, but then I realized after a couple minutes that there was someone behind the shower curtain	Haha. I do that too now."
"Yeah, nobody said anything	Haha that's so funny! I was just talking about this with my friends."
"My girlfriend has been cheating on me with another woman!	Wow, that's some bad news. Are you okay?"
"Yeah, tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men, but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!	How can you do that?"
"Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl, and I was stupid enough to believe her.	I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty. Family always comes first.	That's very inspiring! What made you needed him?"
"I helped him pack the essentials in his wood-paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him. It was the least I could do.	That was nice of you. I hope he was well fed and had a full nights rest."
"Speaking of kids in school, I just found out my son got a B in his world history class at the end of the previous school year. I can't believe it.	That's awesome!  World history is so cool, especially the bits that don't get explained to us."
"No no, see, it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average, I guess. :(	wow thats awesome"
"He seemed fine about it, which is weird because he's always been so proud to bring home straight As. I'm really hoping he does turn it around next year. I also hope he's not on drugs or something. I suppose we'll see.	So I have some amazing news. I recently discovered that my dog can speak to me! Isn't that incredible?	What type of news?"
"I'd say you're certainly right about that! He's got the best Cockney accent though, and won't shut up about philosophy. It's all he wants to talk about! Like okay, we get it, you're suuuuper into Immanuel Kant, cool.	That's so cool! Does he atleast understand you?"
"I mean, let's be honest. I'm the Major League Eating world champion. When I saw that my next closest competition had only ever maxed 40 hot dogs, I knew I had that thing in the bag.	That's pretty awesome! What kind of hot dogs do you like?"
"Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned, however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!	Ha ha, I'm a man of discipline. I would have to admit that major league eating world champions are quite inspiring. But I'm still not quite wild about the idea of paying a visit to someone else's hot dogs. What if someone ate my lunch?"
"Hmph. Well, you should check the by-laws. Major League Eating Official Rulebook page 42, section 4.2.b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement. You must eat the food as is. So I'm afraid I'll have to report you to the governing board and get you disqualified.	I was sick in bed with the flu. My boyfriend took care of me though	That's so sweet of him! He sounds like such a good boyfriend!"
"Yes, I feel much better now.	That's good. Your boyfriend sounds really caring! You should be proud of him!"
"I was leafing through my old photo albums this morning and ran across a picture of me and my mother. I really remember her fondly.	aw that's really cool, did you have the same kind of mom as your mom?"
"Yes, it definitely did. It reminded me of a simpler time, before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony. Oh, I do miss her though. She was just the best!	Awe, that's so sweet, it's nice to remember the good times! Yes, there's definitely a lot we miss her in our life! Hopefully they'll get married someday!"
"I'm just saying I respect her life choices, but she was a great mom while she was around. I think she's brave.	My dog pooped on the floor after I let her in the house.	That is unfortunate. Is the dog potty trained?"
"I told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up.	Oh no! Did the dog take a poop on your house floor too?"
"Honestly? I have a pretty special nephew. He just solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness Millenium Prize problem.	How cool! How old is he/she?"
"Child's play is right, the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have, because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large, which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.	That's awesome! I wish I had kids."
"I've been trying really hard to get a promotion at my company but they just hired someone to fill that spot from outside of the company.	That really stinks. You must be feeling quite lonely."
"My boss is pretty temperamental and doesn't like people questioning his decisions, probably a bad idea.	That is a bummer but maybe it is for the best?"
"My roommate's cat passed away last week. There is a heavy air over the household.	I am so sorry to hear that. It must be tough to have to deal with.  Have you been able to relax and not get stressed?"
"Yeah hes really lost without her. It was unexpected.	oh im sorry to hear that."
"I broke up with my boyfriend last week, and nothing is the same without him.	That's sad, are you going to be okay?"
"Yeah, I know but we were planning to start our lives together. We were moving in and now I have to rethink everything.	Oh no. I'm sorry. Are you okay?"
"I just made the most delicious pie	I love pie! What kind of pie was it"
"It was apple pit,  I let it cool to room temp and ate it with ice cream it was so good.	That sounds so good!"
"I just got a new pair of yeezy shoes and a clean hair cut.	That must be pretty nice."
"I feel on top of the world. I don't know whoever said things can't bring you happiness. They must never owned a pair of Yeezy's	I know right, I have a clean hair too, but I feel like I don't have a soul when people say things can bring someone joy..."
"I just went camping and build the warmest fire.	Oh that sounds like so much fun!!!"
"Yeah, I ended up falling asleep to the dying fire. I felt very safe and secure.	did someone woke you up?"
"I just had to spend the night all alone in the house. The power was out and It was storming outside.	Being alone in the house can be nice sometimes."
"I started a small fire in the trash can to get some light. It almost started a fire.	I'm sorry, that must have been very annoying. I hope it's all over for good"
"I'm a little worried about travelling to dubai	Wao, Why's that"
"These muslim countries can be a bit fanatic	Why are you worried about going there?"
"I left my cell phone on the table at starbucks.	That's terrible! Did it fall on anything bad?"
"Of course, I'm not worried no one would steal from me.	That's really a blessing you didn't get stolen right?"
"I can't help feel stressed about money	I know the feeling. What are you planning to do about money?"
"Yes I just had a major car repair and it took a massive chunk of my savings. $700	Oh man, that's awful! I hope you're able to get another car soon! What a pain in the butt!"
"I felt alone for those 3 weeks she went to visit family	Oh no, how did you cope?"
"lol I played xbox games	i would have felt the same way, went to the beach every week too, sometimes with my friends"
"I usually don't feel the greatest because of health problems.	Has something been wrong?"
"Blood pressure and crohns disease, as well as, a few minor ones. Not sure why but today I feel really good! Slept well, woke up happy and energized	That is good. I hope everything continues to improve for you!"
"You wanna know why I'm not worried about nuclear armageddon? Because I bought a school desk at one of the district auctions, and all I have to do is duck and cover and nuclear fire won't touch me.	Are you being ironic or did you really not read the fine text on the armageddon ordinance?  If it was written in english, you would have had to research it and probably studied the relevant section."
"Ahh, then you know exactly what I mean. I don't see a single thing wrong with my plan. I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about North Korea or Iran or Russia or something when it's just like...get a school desk. It's not hard, people.	Because they don't have nukes?"
"Actually a genius, I love it. Parents and teachers tried to tell us that going to school would prepare us for the world. We just didn't know how right they were, did we?	I have a job interview next week. I'm really nervous.	I am sure you will do great!"
"I'm hoping for the best, but not getting my hopes up too high. I need a new job!!	You'll get the job!! I guarantee it"
"This is going to sound really pathetic, but I'm so happy my new upholstery/carpet cleaner arrived today. Now I can clean!	Congrats! You are very lucky"
"Me too. I live in a first floor apartment and it gets so dusty. Now I'll be able to clean the carpet and the couch! Funny how some strange things lift your spirits.	It's a good time isn't it? Have you been looking for a carpet changer yourself? I have a good pair that are easy to find and are great for carpet cleaning."
"Hope so. I'm moving out of this apartment and into another one in a few weeks, so I want it to be really clean.	My daughter is doing such a great job juggling so many things after having a baby that was premature.	That is awesome.  Do you have any tips for me"
"She really has become such a good mom. I must have done something right ha ha	That's awesome!  How old is she?"
"I'm moving into a new apartment soon. I do hope that the neighbors are nice and quiet.	That sounds nice. Have you met them before?"
"Not really, but my current upstairs neighbors are awful and I feel it'd be worth moving just to get away from them!	That's understandable. I moved out of my parents house 5 years ago and have been lucky to have great neighbors."
"Lucky you! And you're bang on about the 3am parade - sounds like a herd of elephants. Maybe I should speak with the current tenant of my new place before moving - just to see how the neighbors are.	Two years ago we decided to sell off almost everything we owned and move into our RV so we could travel full-time. I was really scared and worried about literally everything lol.	Wow that must be scary! Are you guys set up now?"
"It has been amazing! We have enjoyed every minute of the last 2 years. My kids are seeing and experiencing things that they may have never been able to see or do.	That's awesome!  I can imagine it's a crazy exciting time!  Did you guys have a lot of stuff to sale and what did you need the money for?"
"Thank you! We have had so much fun an dI now realize that I had nothing to be so worried about lol.	Sometimes I look at old pictures of times in my life and kind of wish I could go back for a while.  Do you ever feel like that?	Sometimes I do, especially when my kids are in the house."
"It's good to know others feel the same.  I mean, I love my life right now, but sometimes it would be nice to go to something simpler for a bit.	Yes, it makes you appreciate life a little more.  Do you have any advice for me?"
"I was looking at old pictures the other day and kind of wishing I could go back to those times in my life.	A lot can change. What do you miss most about those days?"
"As much as I can, but some have gotten far enough away that I'm not sure how to track them down anymore.	Aww, I know what you mean. Sometimes I like going through the same old photos just to get a little ""me"" time to remember the past. It makes it feel a little better."
"Sometimes I'm just surprised and amazed at the kindness of others. Recently, one of the maintenance men in our complex delivered a package to me, without my saying anything!	That's nice of them, I wish more people did that."
"It was a carpet/upholstery cleaner and is quite heavy. I'm disabled, so wouldn't have been able to carry it. They don't normally do deliveries, so I thought that was really nice of him to do that.	That is awesome! I would love to have someone like that handy"
"The service they provide is so considerate and thoughtful. I'd probably move out of the complex if it wasn't for the staff!	My friend and I used to play nintendo all day long. it was fun! We used to play ninja turtles and other fun games. Gosh, i miss her so much	I used to play all day as well. We would go street racing in the neighborhood with our neighbor hood gang!"
"yes but she lives in a different country, different time zone so we barely have time to talk. I wish she lived closer	I'm sure she'll make time for you to visit!"
"For me, one of life's greatest pleasures is to be sitting on my porch with a good book and a glass of wine.	I love to be in the house by the pool"
"Lots of things. I like historical novels and legal dramas best. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of relaxation?	Yeah, I love to read too! I like to read a good history too, especially about plantations. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of adventure?"
"There's no finer book to help you in distressful times than the Bible. I hope it gives you a sense of peace to read it. So sorry to hear you're stressed out.	My cousin recently sent me a video from her phone of my home village. What I saw made me mad and sad!	What did he record on your phone?"
"In the North of Scotland. It used to be a quiet little place, and now there are hideous buildings in really prominent places!	That sounds awful. Have you told her to leave it be?"
"Me to. I was even considering moving back there some day, but not after seeing the mess the planners have made of it.	Scotland seems really lonely."
"Yes. I've been here for about 20 years now and love it. But there's something about where I grew up which pulls (or rather pulled) me back.	That sounds pretty sad honestly... where are you from?"
"i love taking care of my little dog i give him everything he need	That's really sweet! What breed is the dog?"
"he is a french puddle and i love him very much	Aww! that sounds sweet! I'm so glad you have such an awesome dog!"
"One time as a surprise for my birthday, my college friends ""kidnapped me""	Kidnapped me? That sounds terrible."
"Nah - I knew that they were just having fun with me!  I was blindfolded and put in the trunk of a big car (I am tiny).	Oh no, did they take anything?"
"Well they took me to a local fountain and dunked me in it!  It was warm out so it was funny and I liked that they cared about me.	i cant stand seeing homeless people in the street, i get really angry and sad at the same time	I feel the same, it's sad. Do you know any homeless people you can go to meet?"
"yes i go to my local charity every weekend	I do not like seeing them either.  What charities do your go to?"
"I won $500 on a scratch off the other day.	That is awesome!  Did you buy anything cool with the money?"
"I'm really not sure. I was shocked to win that much.	Wow! That is awesome! I never win anything. You must have really been excited."
"I'll try not to. I'll probably just save it :)	What were you playing it for? A free prize maybe."
"I was really lonely and depressed at one point, and I had a dinner date with a potato I put googly eyes on.	Oh no, what a gross and revolting thing!"
"Much better, thanks :)  Yeah, I was really just doing anything to feel a connection.	Aw that's sweet! What did the potato look like, b/c there's no potatoes on this earth anymore?"
"I woke up and the first thing I saw that my cat had decided to play with my shoes and ruin them!	Oh gosh!  That's so annoying.  I hope you have a lock."
"I was SO mad! I felt so bad being mad at him	Oh no I can imagine. I would've been mad too!"
"I was confident that I was going to win that prize	What was it that you wanted to win"
"It was a $25 Visa gift card. The competition was a talent show. I didn't win unfortunately but It's ok	I am sorry to hear it did not turn out well for you."
"We decided to try and buy a new kind of sausage from the store. It's SUPER cheap	Are you going to save up for a while?"
"It was! I was super nervous about it though cause of how cheap it was	I would be too, but its always a good decision when you know you can get quality ingredients"
"it is really hard going to the hospital to visit my grandmother	I'm sorry, I've been there before - what's wrong with your grandpa?"
"yeah it is the worst having someone in the hospital	I can imagine, I am sorry to hear about that."
"I'm going to my home country next tuesday and i'm so excited i can't sleep!! It's been 4 years since i've seen my parents	Wow, you're really coming home! Where are you from?"
"Kazakhstan. I miss it and i miss my parents and friends so much	home country checking in!"
"not bruno but borat lol such a stupid movie. I honestly can't stand that actor and his toilet humor	I am super proud of my parents for graduating college	That is an amazing accomplishment!"
"Yeah, they are truly an inspiration that anyone can go to college no matter the age	You sound very happy for them!"
"I am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods	really? That's pretty brave of you. Where ya going?"
"aren't you afraid of the wild animals that will be roaming the area?	I came home one day and found that my dog had unzipped my bookbag, gotten a sandwich I had forgotten I brought home from lunch, and opened the bag it was in without damaging it to eat it.	Oh no! I am glad it didn't dent your bookbag!"
"He's an evil genius.  He tried to get toys out of a christmas stocking one time by climbing on the coffee table.	Haha. Did the whole thing get caught on video?"
"I am impressed in my sisters camping skills. They are very good	What kind of skills does she have that you would consider that impressed her?"
"We went camping and she prepared everything rather quickly including the tents	That's great. Did she get any tips from you on how to properly prepare?"
"I am confident that I will win the gaming tournament in Chicago	what type of game are you playing?"
"Shooting game	Chicago is a pretty big city! Do you play?"
"When I go up with my skydiving students I feel proud when they do well	That's cool! Have you done any yourself?"
"I have been instructing for 12 years but skydiving for 25	Oh wow that's a long time! What are you most excited for?"
"You shoudl definitely try it!	Well, recently at physical therapy I walked the length of the treatment room with the help of a cane. I'm feeling quite good about that!	That is great, did you do it on your own?"
"Considering I've been using a walker for the past two years, yes it is. Thanks!	Oh, that's wonderful! My husband and I did that a couple weeks ago. We were having trouble walking for a few minutes at a time, but we had a cane. It's good that your doctor is able to see things like that for you."
"Every day I practice - I'll be back on the golf course in no time, lol.	I am so upset that a public road in front of my house closed because of a limestone mine.	That's a bummer! Do you have plans on fixing the problem?"
"It is hard because cars come up the road all the time and turn around in my drive.	That's horrible. I hope you had someone there to call a tow truck to come fix it!"
"I just have to wait for the city to fix the collapsed road and reopen the road again.	I am hopeful that I will win my ebay bid	oh yeah? how much is your bid?"
"I am bidding on a rare comic book	What is the name of the book? I may have to buy it!"
"I was walking home one time and a really big dog came charging out from a house at me barking really loudly.	That is scary! Did you chase it and knock it out of its owner's house?"
"Thankfully not really, it stopped near me and barked a lot until someone got it, but it was really frightening until it was retrieved.	I am glad that it was not hurt."
"it is incredible to see how technology has advanced these past days	I agree! Have you worked with technology in the past?"
"well the phones are basically a 1990's computer	I agree! I had an amazing experience using my smart phone a few years back"

"It was! I just couldn't stop! It was so good that I just had to keep eating	What kind of cake was it?"
"I am prepared to help my family financially whenever they need it	That is a very Lucas arts y thing to do!  You must be proud!"
"Ehh, its not the best but it's not bad either\	That's good! It's nice that you want to help when they're in trouble."
"I was afraid when I saw that horror film in the theater	Horrible film! What was it?  Was it scary??  I've always wanted to see one"
"It was the First Purge	Oh no! I have not seen that one either! What was so bad about it?"
"Wandering around my little area of the world I am quite pleased with the variety of stores and restaurants here. I didn't expect it.	I love traveling. Where do you like to eat?"
"Nice! You just don't expect it in a rural area. Well, I didn't anyway. We have large grocery stores and a little (but very good) organic grocery store. Quite incredible.	That is very nice. I am glad you're happy with it. What do you grow in your area?"
"I find it hard to believe, myself! This is the rural south, yet there are fine dining restaurants, the aforementioned store, really good independent stores selling all sorts of stuff.	i hate when i do dishes and touch food that was on the plate1! so gross. makes me wanna throw up	I feel you! That's like when you take out the trash and the can is covered in maggots! Ugh so gross!!"
"because the food is all soggy and mushy. i don't know, such a yucky feeling	I know right. It's like the food industry is milking these cow-seselfs for us."
"i really hate when my kids leave their dirty clothes on the floor	I know that feel. I had that happen with shoes today."
"yeah they even have a bin specially for that	thats annoying"
"i hate people that cut lane in traffic without signaling it	Me too, it's like they think your a police officer or something."
"yeah it really makes me mad to see that people dont care about these types of things	Me too, I wish we had lights on our dash cam to help us see the bad drivers."
"I found a rabbit that had been shot by someone in my yard	Did you then keep it in the yard, or did you eventually find it?"
"Thank goodness it was dead, poor thing is not suffering, but some people can be so cruel.	That's really sad. I wonder if they had a family? It's really hard to know how to respond in times like that."
"We had been holding off trying a new restaurant in town.	Oh? What kind of restaurant to you trying to open up? And is it a small business?"
"It's a little pricey and I'm worried I won't like the food and waste all that money. It has good reviews though	That's a risk you are willing to run but if its a quality place I dont sweat it"
"Our local organic store now stocks Indian food made by a local Indian lady - heaven, heaven, heaven!	I love it when places like that do good job"
"About once a week. Her husband works in the store, so he brings her food in regularly. It's such a pleasure to find such a thing - I missed my Indian food!	That's great! I love indian food! I'm so glad they still made it! I'm not a huge fan of Indian food generally, but I do love a good chinese!"
"Well, my uncle's Indian and his sisters and mother taught my aunt to cook, and she taught me. But I'm disabled right now so can't cook much. This is such a find!	I have been working on  my jump shot all month.	Nice. Has it improved a lot from before?"
"I hope so I have a big horse tournament against my buddies I want to win the 100 bucks prize.	That's pretty cool. What kind of game is it?"
"One of my neighbors (next building and two floors up) plays talk radio every morning Very Loudly.	Talk radio? I don't even know what that is. Is it some kind of noise maker?"
"Not until about 8am, but it's so loud I can hear it in my first floor apartment with the doors and windows closed. Idiot man!	That would make my life so annoying!"
"Yikes! Why are some people such inconsiderate creeps? It makes me really mad!	Some people are just so rude!"
"I've called management twice about it and both times he quietened down - for about two days. Then up it goes again!	I would say that he is inconsiderate as well! I would just yell at him and move on."
"Nothing in life is certain, the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you.	That is a very good way to have faith. I think we are all just gonna wait and see what happens."
"I have just bought a ticket to a britney spears live show in vegas.	That's sounds like fun! What do you look to do with your time?"
"The show is in three months, I hope she sings he late 90s hits.	Wow that sounds like it will be a great time. Who is she playing with then?"
"Our Property Management team just emailed me to say I've got the apartment I wanted!	Awesome! I bet you worked very hard to secure such a nice place."
"It really was - I can't wait to move in! It's a smaller apartment, but quieter (I hope!).	Congratulations! I wish you the best of luck moving!"
"You'll get there. It really is nice to have your own space. Do you live at home?	I do. I'm just over 30 years of married life. But when my husband gets older and gets married- it'll be nice to not have to hear his crazy crazy crazy stories when I come home!"
"Good for you! Start saving your money now - believe me, you'll need it!	I was on the patio and a giant roach crawled out from underneath.	That's pretty terrifying!  What did you do?"
"It was almost as bug as a golf ball I felt like throwing up.	That's pretty nasty...I'm glad you took some precautions...bug repellants won't help you kill them, but they sure can help!"
"I have quite a long drive ahead of me next month. It's about 1/12 hours, but I've don it before so I'll be fine.	Are you worried at all about being late for your meeting?  I hope it's not as bad as you worry!  Do you have any car trouble getting to where you are going?"
"I put music on and open the window. Otherwise I'll disappear into my own little world, and that's not a good thing to do when you're driving!	You are so right. Sometimes I envy drivers because they are so prepared for their long drives."
"It really helps to pass the time, not to mention it can calm you down. And the drive's quite easy and very pretty, which help.	I was so amped yesterday. I got to pick up my now computer for the store!	Nice, what kind of computer is it. I have a pretty big one I got around 2000 years ago and still run like new!"
"It was just a new model HP that I bought but I'm so excited!	What a great surprise! Is it a laptop you've been wanting? Or are you just excited for the new features?"
"I get my groceries delivered to my home and am so grateful for the service.	Really? What type of groceries do you want to get delivered?"
"It helps me a lot as I'm disabled and it can be quite difficult. Anyway, I hate grocery shopping!	It is difficult and expensive to do online!"
"Ugh. And don't even get me started on ""mini-shoppers"" racing round the aisles screeching! Much better to have someone else buy for me!	I just watched the notebook, pretty depressing movie.	Oh, yeah. It kind of makes you want to throw away all your hard drives, though."
"It's a romantic love story. Doesn't end so well for the main character.	Oh I've heard of this movie before! I didn't like it at all. What don't you like about the movie?"
"my little boy learned how to  count to ten eeven know he is super young	Wow, that is such a cool thing to hear about little boys.  Does he also do other things well, too?"
"yeah i was so proud of him as well i thought i would have to wait months till he got to that point	Wow, he is really growing up, I bet it will help him along the way!"
"I just went to the park today.	Oh yeah did you do anything cool?"
"I was going to hang out, but I ended up tripping and smashing my toe up into a rock.	Ouch! I'm sorry! I know that must hurt, but it's happened to everyone, so you're just going to feel okay about it."
"my little brother dumped a glass of water on me this morning to wake me up	Oh wow! Why didn't he tell you!"
"yeah i was furious we are in some sort of a prank war	That is terrible. Did you retaliate?"
"Last night there was a really strange animal screaming outside my window in the middle of the night	Whoa! What happened?"
"Turned out to be a skunk! It sounded so strange!	Oh, that's terrible!  What did you do about it?"
"When I was in college I travelled all over Europe one semester.	Did it bring back any good memories?"
"I love all over Italy, but I also loved Germany and France and Spain.	Oh that sounds wonderful. I visited Spain once, it was beautiful continent by far the best in Europe"
"Yes it was truly an amazing time meeting people from so many different cultures	We went on vacation and the kids stayed home. I couldn't believe it when I walked in the door and the house was totally clean.	That's nice! It's been a while since I've seen my kids. Did you have fun with the house cleaning?"
"Wonders never cease to amaze me. First time for everything I guess, lol	That is pretty amazing! Where did yall go?"
"I totally thought the same thing. Too funny (but you might be right)	Yeah, sometimes it's fun to imagine what other people have going on, even if you don't know exactly what they have."
"I went ziplining the other day	How was it going?"
"I found it using the Internet.  It was a lot of hiking but they had a lot of long lines.	Did you have to wait forever for your turn? I always hate waiting."
"Yes I did - I had a great time and met some fun people.	I smashed my finger in the door last night	How did that happen?"
"I iced it up but I was so mad because it was my fault for slamming the door	Oh no! How'd it get caught?"
"We might have to put our dog down soon.	I'm sorry, is it a young dog or older one?"
"Yes, she's getting older and she's just getting to that point she can't move around good.	im sorry to hear that."

"California. I'm ready for my kids to try out some new schools and be happier :)	That's great! I was actually just about to ask the same question! Have yo moved before?"
"i cannot stand seeing people throw trash on the streets	yea it is so nasty"
"i know right i feel like doing that every time but i dont want to get arrested hahaha let karma get them,	That is exactly how I feel. I feel bad when people do that but at least we can trash the streets together."
"I am by myself most of the time in a isolated area. I only have animals as my friends.,5|5|4_5|5|5,	That seems really isolated."
"Sometimes it makes me sad, but than I think how happy my animal friends makes me feel.	That is sad but also has it advantages too."
"I bought 100 packs of magic cards and didn't get a single good card.	I'm sorry to hear that. I've spent way too much on packs on the hobby."
"Collectible cards. My friend bought only a few packs and got incredible cards.	Wow that's terrible. Maybe they should have a lottery like they do for movies."
"I feel really bad that we have to board our dog when we go on vacation next week.	Oh no! I hope your dog is okay! Is it boarding because something bad or just upset?"
"We are going to a place at the beach that doesn't allow pets with some friends. Our vet also has a kennel there to board dogs so I guess that's what we'll do. She'll be so sad though.	Maybe your vet should train her to go to the beach instead?"
"I actually recently applied for a few jobs myself, Crossing my fingers for something better than my current one.	Well I hope something comes up for you."

"I have been thinking about moving but I have lived here for over 30 years. The area has changed so much.	What are you going to do? You have to protect your family!"
"My fear is that I wont find a safer place. Not much money to find a good neighborhood to move into.	I went out to the country to gaze at some stars.	That sounds like a great adventure! What did you see?"
"I was overwhelmed by the enormity of the universe.	wow, where did you go?"
"My kids birthday was last weekend, my whole family showed up! they didn't even tell me they were coming	That's awesome! Did you have fun?"

"I read the instructions to set up my fit bit 100 times.	Did you end up doing it right?"
"I need it to work perfectly I need to get ready for a marathon and I need it to track my progress.	What is your marathon distance?"
"I have a big speech to give.	Are you prepared? Are you worried?"
"Well I don't really know many of the people I will be in front of, so hopefully I don't stutter or something.	I'm sure if you just try to be quiet it should be okay"
"I left my purse at in the seat in starbucks.	Oh that's really frustrating. Did you manage to get it back ok?"
"I was in a safe neighborhood so i wasn't worried.	That is really lucky. Where did you leave it?"
"I was able to say the entire alphabet backwards.	How did that happen?"
"no time, I have a great memory, It was on a dare I nailed it perfectly.	Wow, amazing! How long did it take you to memorize that?"
"I have been looking at pictures of crazy car crashes.	I've been looking at a lot of my girlfriend. She's been kind of flake out lately, though. Do you have pictures of any of yours that you've been through, by chance?"
"Seriously now I can't drive anywhere. I can't even leave the house for fear of car crashes.	That's so sad! Are you planning to buy a dash cam for your car?"
"I was at the mall yesterday. I sat down for a few minutes and when I looked away someone stole my shopping bags.	Wow, that's really scary. Did they leave anything behind?"
"No. I didn't notice right away. How could someone do that. Im so so mad!	I don't know how some people can be so inconsiderate!"
"I was in a hospital and a guy game in with some really bad burns.	That's scary! I hope no one was hurt."
"No idea, but I had never seen something like that in person. It looked painful.	Oh my goodness that's horrible! I can't imagine how terrible that must have felt. How are they doing?"
"I saw a guy deadlift 700lbs at the gym the other day. I was in awe.	Wow! That's pretty amazing! I wonder how he kept going after going through that."
"Yeah it is, it seemed like he had every plate in the gym on the bar. I've never seen someone lift that much in person before.	Wow. Deadlifting 700lbs is pretty amazing!  And I bet you were panting afterwards!"
"I got to go to a cat cafe when no one else was around!	That sounds like a lot of fun! Did they have a cat cafe where you were?"
"It was! I was the only one around so all the cats came to spend time with me	That's so nice! You can make friends outside of your comfort zone."
"I walked out to my car theo ther day and felt something hit my face.	Oh, that's terrible!  I hope it's nothing serious"
"A GIANT SPIDER! It was terrible and I was so startled!	Oh my, did you get nasty and run for cover?"
"When I can home, my cat was laying on the pile of laundry that I had pulled out of the dryer before work. Now it's covered in hair.	That is so gross!"
"Well it's pretty inconvenient, that's for sure. Nothing I can really do about it now. Just got to keep the door closed I guess.	That is so inconvenient! I would take the cat to the salon."
"Today when I went into my roommate's office to fix the internet, I noticed the collar of his old cat that passed away. I miss her.	oh no. I bet you miss him a ton!"
"Yeah, she wasn't my favorite cat, but I still miss her. Cancer sucks.	That's sad, how old was she?"
"Sometimes an old song runs through my head and I remember the times where I used to listen to songs so many times that I memorized the words	What was the song that you had like that?  Were you a kid?"
"Like old kind of emo songs, full of angst and whatnot	Older Me? Is it an older song or an intro to another kind of MeMeMe?"
"The other night when I was taking my dog out to go to the bathroom really late. I heard some rustling in the bushes and panicked.	Were they the same size?"
"Oh she was ready to fight whatever it was, but she was on a leash thankfully. No, I'm just really easily started, all that anxiety over an armadillo. Im so ashamed lol.	Did the armadillo follow you and make you fight it?"
"I found an injured bird in my yard today, it was only a baby to!	Did you nurse it back to health and give it a splint?"
"Yes, I had to call my local wildlife rescue center to come get it. I hope its okay, they said they think it has a broken wing.	Oh no! That's awful! I hope it wasn't a black racer?"
"I have a friend coming over soon and I keep checking out the window to see if theyre here yet.	Have they arrived?"
"I am making dinner for the both of us. I have a roast in the oven. It smells so good I can't wait until it is ready.	Roast is one of my favorite foods, I'm glad it'll be good."
"My boss finally noticed my hard work and gave me a pay raise!	Oh that's awesome! You must have really appreciated that too!"
"No not at all! I'm excited because now I can plan a family vacation for this winter.	That is great. You must really be excited and relieved!"
"I have a deadline at work coming up.	Oh no, do you think it's going to be cancelled?"
"It is top-secret. But every time I try and get serious work done, my co-workers won't leave me alone.	Top secret? Why do they do that? Is there something about being alone that keeps them from getting any good stuff done?"
"My roommate has been gone all week. I don't have anything to do without him here.	Thats sounds lonely. Do you talk often with him/her?"
"It's just not the same doing something by myself. I don't have anyone to go do stuff with.	Do you have any friends to invite? Or do you have to do it by yourself?"
"We just adopted a dog from the shelter last week and I think she is sick with parvo.	I am sorry to hear that. I have had to put a dog up for adoption who was not able to find, and it is hard when it seems like no one matches."
"It's a deadly dog illness, basically a virus that often leads to death. We think she caught it at the shelter.	oh wow i hope she starts feeling better soon. that's awful"
"Yes, they have to do a fecal sample and test it. We take her in tomorrow to see.	Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry to hear you're having to put her down. I hope everything is OK."
"Thank you!	We are planning on going on a cruise in December!	That's awesome. Where to?"
"No, I went on one in highschool but first one with my husband and daughter. It's has been so fun planning it together!	That sounds so fun! Where are you going cruiseishing?"
"I came home today and my roommate was cooking dinner, all i had to do was fix my plate. It was so nice.	That is so nice! You are lucky."
"I sure did, and the food was delicious. I'll have to surprise him with dinner next time.	Thats great! I love cooking for people.  Im an oven but always wanted to try grill some food.  What's your favorite dishes to make?"
"What kind of pizza place is it?	We are suppose to be having a bad storm this weekend.	Oh no, bad storms? That's never fun. Hopefully it cleared by Friday."
"Yes, makes you wonder if its global warming. I have been stocking up on food and supplies. Ready for the worst.	Oh my gosh, I hope that it doesn't warm up to much!"
"My husband just got called back into work, was not expecting that!	What did he do?"
"Someone stole some gear, so they called everyone back to investiage. We had just sat down to eat dinner to!	What? That's crazy, I would fight for that stuff back if they came after us! What are you gonna do?"
"He is in the military so technically he can be called in 24/7 and is payed on salary!	I just prepared an amazing plate of mac and cheese.	I love mac and cheese, what is on it?"
"It is so good if you add the right amount of pepper.	I like pepper, where do you find it?"
"I just bought a brand new necklace and shirt.	What kind of necklace and shirt?"
"Not sure I just though it looked cool. Hopefully it gets me noticed.	What brand did you get?"
"My dog keeps having accidents in the house! I'm getting fustrated.	That's terrible accidents happen to everyone. Have you talked to him about it?"
"Thank you, I will. I think she is doing it to mark her territory, it started when we brought a new dog home.	My thoughts and prayers are with you...I hope this little accident doesn't continue!"
"When I was promoted to Team Leader at work, I really felt like all my hard work had paid off, to some extent, and I gave myself a little pat on the back.	That sounds wonderful! You sound like a hard working individual."
"Yes, and it can be difficult at times to move up at places, especially when there are many other long timers there!	It can be. But as long as you stay committed you will do fine."
"I can't wait to go to the water park this weekend.	Which water park?"
"Yes, my kids love it so they are going to be so happy when we get there.	That will be so much fun!"
"I'm just laying in bed with a scented candle burning in my room and my cat on my lap, things couldn't be any better.	Yea I am in that camp right now. I love cats but it's so hot. What's the cat doing to make you feel so nice?"
"Yeah my kitty is just purring away, we're having a good time watching youtube.	Awww! Sounds like a nice night!"
"My mom sent my daughter a toy I played with when I was a child!	That was a fun toy. Was it a nice toy?"
"Yes, it was neat to see her play with it. It'll make some great photos, since I have one of me playing with it at her age.	What toy was it?"
"Six months ago my boyfriend proposed to me and we are getting married next month. I can't wait	Congrats! That's exciting!"
"On a honeymoon, lol? Not right away. He is totally the man of my dreams. I'm so lucky	Congratulations! That sounds like so much fun!"
"My husband might loose his job, I'm not sure what we will do if he does.	What kind of job does he lose? Does he qualify?"
"The company is downsizing and cutting a lot of departments. His hasn't been cut yet but there are rumors!	That is horrible! I hope everything happens for you!"
"I found out my childhood cat passed away	I'm sorry, how old was it"
"I do too, it was so sad.	I'm so sorry! Losing a pet is like losing a family member I know :("
"My daughter is such a talented and creative young artist. When she was nominated to be 'Most Artistic' at school, I felt very secure she would win, because she really is amazing!	I bet she feels a lot like you when she wins!"
"She did! I know I'm the parent so can be biased, but it's really so impressive how well she draws, paints, shades....	that is very cool! I wish i could be like her.. I am still a no artist but i have gotten pretty good at learning"
"I was very ready for my first car crash	Sorry to hear about your car wreck. Was it your first time? How are you doing now after your experience?"
"I had all the paperwork set and ready, I had a blanket cause it was in the winter.	Did you survive the wreck?"
"Last night a fly got into the bedroom and wouldn't stop trying to land on my face	I hate flies so much. Did you try anything?"
"It was terrible! Right as I was about to fall asleep the dang thing would land on my nose!	That's some intense turbulence!"
"I left my dog alone in the house when I went to get the mail. While I was gone she got in the cat box and ate the cat poop, super gross.	Oh my gosh! What did the mail bring you?"
"There was nothing to clean.... she definitely swallowed it. I stuck her outside cause I can't even think about dealing with her licking anything right now. Gives me the hebbie jibbes thinking about it.	I can imagine. I would have left the cat box out in the sun for days. I am sure she will get over it."
"I have been practicing my speech for days now.	For what sport?"
"I have the perfect delivery and all the talking points drilled down. I will be impressive	When do you go in for your first speech? And what do you want to say to the judge when you do it?"
"My cat puked up a hairball this morning and I had to clean it up.	That is gross. Did it clean up easily?"
"She pukes up hairballs every now and then I have some salmon flavored jelly i can feed her, but it happens so infrequently I forget to.	My cat does the same thing! I have a hairball in the bathtub! It is horrifying! I am so sorry."
"When I left the bathroom in high school once I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe.	Oh no! That's pretty gross! Did anyone help you?"
"Yeah it sure was, you know how mean teenagers can be. It's like they have no empathy or think about what if it was them.	I hate being that person...I've had so many bad experiences like that. It makes me really question my own humanity"
"I got a new type of pizza I wanted to try	Nice. What type did you get."
"A normal pepperoni but it was terrible!	Did you try any of the others types of pizza? If you like that you might need to find one with extra toppings!"
"When I was in Costa Rica I was having a lot of trouble with the address of my AirBnB, I was so lost.	Did you ever find it out?"
"It was because my Spanish was a bit lacking, it also didn't help that people kept giving me bad directions. I eventually stumbled on it but for a while I was worried I would never make it there.	Did you ever make it there by yourself or with a group?"
"I was caught off guard when the gun fired for a race I was in	Really, did anyone else hear it? Did it go off?"
"Yeah, I forgot to take my sweat pants off, that's when I realized running isn't for me	It's for everyone isn't it? I was surprised when I didn't have a shirt tucked into my pants by the end of the race."
"I slept with a new girl last week	That's nice. What did she do to impress you so much?"
"Not really	That's unfortunate. How did that turn out for ya?"
"Not really. We were very high. We were drunk. But now I feel bad for my partner	I was eating dinner with my husband last night and I was so happy	That sounds nice! what did you guys eat?"
"I whole heatedly agree! It was just so freeing and peaceful	That sounds so good! It is always nice to have a nice dinner cooked with care"
"Someone came to my door with a gun the other day.	that is not good, is the police there?"
"I called the police after he robbed me.	Oh, that's terrible. I'm glad there's someone you can call if you need help."
"No, thankfully, I'm fine but scared.	I left my food on the coffee table and my dog ate it.	I hope your dog wasn't too upset about that. Did it make you late to get home?"
"No, she is fine. I had to find something else to eat though.	Awwww. I love dogs who are dedicated"
"I was trying to study for a test one night and my brother was listening to loud music	Did he turn out okay?"
"I would have totally flipped the circuit breaker if I knew how, but I just asked him to turn it down	Did he flip it down?"
"My dog tried to eat her poo	That's gross!"
"It probably will.	Oh no, was her poop delicious?"
"I borrowed a book from the library the other day but I left it outside	What happened to the paper?"
"Yes it did, unfortunately	What book was it? I hope it wasn't one of those FloridaMan ones?"
"I got something nice the other day, chocolates from my husband	Nice! What was it?"
"It was, and he does that type of thing a lot.	What kind of things does he buy?"
"I have problems with the city and their constant tax increase on my property.	Yeah that's a bummer.  It seems the city messed up quite a lot over the past 10 years.  Are you living on a fixed address?"
"Maybe A move out of my state would be the answer and a blessing to the high taxes.	What city are in right now?"
"I always do the same, it's not had when they are perfect.	That is a good attitude."
"My girlfriend, How about you? do you have a partner?	I do! I have a girlfriend, do you?"
"Wow. Looks like you are doing a good job.	I close on my new house Monday, I didn't think I was going to be able to purchase it but I believed in my mortgage adviser	That sounds great! I'm happy it didn't go to your crazy though!"
"Surprisingly it's been a painless process. I'm very thankful.	It can be hard to find something that will loan out at the right interest.  What was wrong with it?"
"I gave my friend some money that she said she would pay back but she hasn't yet.	How long will it be until she gets it?"
"I really thought  I could count on her, but now I haven't even heard a word from her. Lesson learned I guess.	Lesson learned, sounds a lot like you learned a lesson for sure!"
"I actually did this, i'm terrible.	What did you do?"
"I stole my mother's card details to pay for a subscription.	Haha, that's embarrassing. What kind of card was it and what were the payments for?"
"We are going to Six Flags this weekend and my kids want me to ride the roller coaster with them.	Thats sounds like so much fun!"
"I'm really hesitant to get on. It's been a long time since I've ridden one and I don't think I'm going to like it at all	Get the kids one they will love it."
"When i lost my dog of 12 years i was devastated...	That's so sad. What breed was it?"
"It is a horrible experience and i hope that i never have to go through it again, how did yours die?	It's actually my wife that lost him not me lol! I am so sorry. It was an awful experience and i hope that you can get over it somehow!"
"I think that in the past i have spent time caring about things that aren't important.	What things aren?"
"Money mostly. I just wish i could have enough of it to be set for life.	I hear you on that one! Money seems to be the one thing we all have to care for."
"I love thinking back to when I was growing up and the neighborhood we lived in. So many great memories.	do you like to walk around with your old friends"

"My husband was teaching me how to make a steak. The flame was so warm!	That sounds so awesome! What temperature did you end up turning it to, and how did you do?"
"It was but I was so sad that I was so scared	Did he enjoy teaching?"
"I looked at my childhood photos the other day. I remember alled the fun I used to ahve	did it bring a lot of memories"
"I do to. It was much easier then for me	I can relate. It was not an easy life."
"I have to rely on my prayers and my belief in a high power to get me through not having a job and no money.	I completely understand. I have to rely on that as well. It's the only thing I can do to help get through my prayers!"
"I remind myself all the time that it will work out and all will be good again.	Well I hope that it does as you have a lot to be grateful for :)"
"I was very sad when I found out that my neighbors houses were going to be demolished because the city ordered it..	Oh no, that's so sad. Do you know why they were ordered so close to the new building?"
"Nope. They bought them out at city valued tax prices and they have 60 days to find another place to live.	Wow, they are completely out of control! Why did they do it?"
"I feel off my bike the other day. it hurt.	What happened? Is it something on your tire?"

"Isn't it annoying when your friends earn more money then you but you work just as hard.	I know right. I wish I was as jealous as you are."
"Very true. I suppose i just get a bit jealous sometimes.	It really is.  Sometimes you have to earn what you can with what you know."

"Do you remember the old video games you used to play?	Yes, all of the ones I enjoyed with my parents. What kind of video games did you like to play?"
"The nostalgic moments when you play them again is brilliant. You should try it.	I sure do, I play a lot of N64 games. What are your favorites?"
"Life seems to be going perfect right now, how about you?	I'm pretty great, not the greatest since birth, but I'm loving every minute!"
"Well that's even better news! i'm feeling hopeful for the both of us.	that's awesome, glad youre having such an awesome day!"
"A girl i went on two dates with wanted a copy of my house key, yikes!	Wow! Two dates and you still have the same key?"

"My family dragged me along to visit an underground cave recently, I was pretty nervous.	Oh wow! Sounds super exciting! Did you have fun?"
"It was nice, after i got over the fear from being 23 stories underground.	What are you talking about?  Did something in particular make you nervous?  Was it scary in general?  That sounds exciting!"
"Hah, no i wasn't thinking of being trapped. It just seemed like more effort to breath for some reason.	Had a job interview the other day.	How did it go?"
"I think it went alright, i was incredibly anxious about it.	How did it go?"
"Ate my flatmates last chocolate bar earlier.	Did they enjoy it?"
"Nope, i do feel a bit guilty about it but they should have hid it better.	LOL!  I guess you were hungry after all!  Did you ask your flatmate to buy you more?"
"I went bungie jumping with some friends but I was reluctant to jump.	Did you hurt your self?"

"I always try to tell my kids they need to be kind and understanding to others, no matter what.	That is a very nice thing to say."
"They try but it's hard when there are so many bullies at school. I wish other parents would try to do the same.	Yes it is really difficult and expensive to do that. Bullies are horrible and should not have their presence in our society."
"Do you know how much work goes into video games?	I do. I have several game rigs in the works right now."

"6	I lent my brother 200 dollars so he could buy cryptokitties.	Oh wow, I hope he takes care of it."
"I really couldn't tell you some kind of digital cat, he says he will pay me back, so hopefully it all works out.	What are these crypto-note cards? Do you have any idea what I should do with them?"
"Everyone wanted to go skydiving for my birthday.	Oh really? Well if you're not in a rush I can totally understand"

"On my back! I went to work like this!	That's hilarious!  Did anyone notice?"
"Someone decided to slash my car tires, key my car, and bash in my windshield.	Did this person at least ask for insurance?"
"Probably a spurned former lover. Glad I had insurance.	Holy moly! Sounds like someone needs a taste of their own medicine."
"I have to give a speech at my fathers funeral. I drew the short straw.	How old is he now? Use that with him as a personal lesson"
"Not really, I just needed to make sure that It goes off without a hitch. I don't want to embarrass my Mother.	I'm sure you'll be fine! Don't let it bother you too much!"
"I've been working at my same job for 12 years.	Oh wow. 12 Years! That's a long time! Are you still the same job?"
"Yes I do.  Its a fun job.	That's a long work term. Do you get to enjoy it every day?"
"Yes I am a skydiving instructor so it is fun	Awesome! I'm glad you're happy with it. What's your favorite part of the job?"
"Yes I love it	On a recent trip there was some bad weather that caused my flight to be delayed several hours. It was already late so i was afraid they would cancel the flight altogether.	That sounds awful! Did you get on and go on the next flight?"
"Yes! Thank goodness. They didn't cancel. I just got home much later than I had hoped.	Thats great. Its nice to have some peace in this rough week!"
"Absolutely. I had too much to do the next day to not show up then.	I literally ate all you could eat at a chinese buffet	What was in your stomach?  Did you get sick?"
"I had to go home and lie down for the greatest nap of my life.	OMG! I have never been so jealous! I would be too!"
"Recently went on a family vacation to an old spot we used to go when we were all younger. It was nice to see old stuff and talk about old times.	Sounds like fun. Did you do anything with your siblings while you were on the vacation?"
"Oh for sure. I'm always a sucker for nostalgia.	Old places and memories can bring about a lot of happy emotions too. I'm glad you were able too. :) Where was the place you went?"
"I love looking through them. I even find myself clicking back to my oldest pictures on facebook and reliving those times in my head.	One night during college I got a phone call in the middle of the night that one of my best friends had been killed in a car wreck.	Oh, my goodness! That's so sad!"
"Absolutely. It was really the first time I had lost someone close to me, family or friend.	That is so sad.   I am glad you feel your friend was really hurt.   What happened?"
"My birthday was a few days ago, I can't believe my wife had the wait staff sing to me.	Did you like the sing?"
"Hah, its good entertainment, but i don't exactly enjoy being in the spotlight. Thanks!	You are very lucky to have such an awesome wife!"
"I recently got married and I'm so lucky to have found someone who enjoys doing the same things that I do.	Marriage is the most important thing ever."
"Thank you. It is nice. This is a second marriage for us both and I like that we are both happy with things just the way they are, no high expectations	I'm happy for you!"
"I lost my wallet last week	I hope you didnt lose a lot of money.  Its a very expensive habit."
"My friend freaked out but I was pretty sure I left it at a restaurant and I trusted in my fellow humans to turn it in	It is really sad. I have lost many"
"Yes it was turned in - cash and credit cards all there	I recently had the opportunity to help out at my local Second Harvest food bank.	That's amazing! What did they offer?"
"It was great. I was with a good group of people too. We made it fun.	What is Second harvest? I have not heard of it."
"For sure. I am happy I had the opportunity. Im sure I will do it again.	I'm happily married and employed, life is in a pretty good spot right now.	That is awesome. It is nice to be happy"
"For sure. I've had some unstable times in my life. I'm thankful to be where I am now.	That's wonderful! I am glad to hear that. You must be quite content at the moment."
"Absolutely!	That's cool. What makes you happy now?"
"Yesterday my car ran out of oil and broke down. I could not believe I would let such a thing happen!	Oh no! That's an awful feeling! What happened next."
"The engine is totally shot, its not designed to run without any. So now I have to go shopping for a new car.	I would hate to have to do that.  Were you able to get a good deal on a new one before the accident?"
"The new car is more expensive than a new engine. But I can't justify such a costly repair on my car.	I understand. You can spend a lot for less."
"It does drops a lot after a repair like that. I might as well invest that money into something new.	I was in a big party city and the street was crowded with people. As I was walking my foot got tangled up on something and I went face first into a huge flower bed.	That's a rough one! I'm glad you're ok."
"It hurt my pride more than it hurt my face.	I am sorry to that. I bet it was embarrassing for you"
"That is true. Plus it was a big party area so Im sure a lot of them drunk anyway.	Ahh, I get it now! You shouldn't be ashamed though! It's a healthy celebration of the accomplishment you've made!"
"Literally anytime I order something online and I get the tracking I immediately start checking it. I am so impatient waiting on stuff to come.	I know how that is, I also have that issue.  What country do you live in?  I hope they have it here!"
"Yes. Every single time. I know better. But I just cant help myself but to check over and over	I do that too! I ordered something a few weeks back and when it got here the other day, there was a little box with the tracking info for the next step but it wasn't in the actual package.. I checked that all day yesterday!"
"That is true.	My dog died of old age last year and I miss her	Awwww.. that's so sad. I'm sorry for your loss.."
"Yes.  She was the most wonderful dog ever	Aww that is so hard.  I am so sorry :( What was she that you had with you her whole life?"
"Laugh!  Yes dogs are far better creatures than humans	I'm gonna take the family out to the lake this weekend, we might rent a boat.	That sounds like so much fun!!!"
"Maybe a pontoon boat, depends on what they have. Should be a nice way to unwind.	Aww that's so nice! That sounds like so much fun!"
"I have a friend with loaded parents. She doesn't work but has anything she wants anytime she wants.	thats the worst, when i see parents like that i feel so bad for them"
"Mine aren't poor but they aren't loaded. They struggle. Same for me. I work my butt of for what I have.	That's hard, I'm sorry."
"Same. I do wish I had a little bit more money to do a few more things though.	I am sorry you dont have more"
"I had to do a lot of learning to knock out a big project at work. Finally finished and ready for another.	That's awesome! What was the project?"
"For sure. It was a software coding project for a client. A lot of which I did not understand at the start.	That's a lot of boilerplate. Did it take a long time to learn?"
"Thank you. But now I have it ready for the next one.	That's good, it's always good to be prepared"
"I have many health problems that require me to see many different speccialist	I'm sorry that you have to deal with that.   Have you seen one doctor so far?"
"I am working towards that..I have been lucky to find some great doctors which I am able to put faith in because my life is essentially in their hands	It is good that you have a healthy and happy life."
"I had a super stressful week and ended up cheating on my diet last night by eating pizza and cake.	Well, I suppose that's partly why it was stressed and not because you ate too much. We all over eat when it comes to food and it's unhealthy, so don't feel bad for doing it when it should have been natural to overeat even when stressed. It can all even out eventually."
"Yes, otherwise I had stuck to it - but my weekly weigh in was this morning and I was up two pounds. I felt so irritated!!!!	Well, you cheated and got a taste of his, that's for sure"
"I'm a bit nervous- I have an upcoming certification exam to take for my teaching license and it's a big deal.	That's exciting!  I hope you do well on your exam!"
"I've been studying a WHOLE lot - so I think I'll do okay, but it's still making me feel nervous.	It will go fine, just relax and do your best!"
"There was a group project due and we had a meeting, but i missed it because it was my 21st birthday. wasnt my best day	Oh well that's ok.  Did they make an exception to thedule?"

"I have many health problems but I feel so lucky to have a great support system in my family	It's good to have a good family. Do they live close by?"
"It really is!  It is wonderful to know how much they love me!	Being healthy is so important!"
"I was so sad when I had to put my dog down last year	oh my, sorry to hear that"
"She was 12.  It was old age but it was so hard because I had had her for years.	Sorry for the loss of your sweet beast, are you doing better now?"
"I wanted to buy a new car, but I wasn't sure about buying the one I got.	Did you research the model and choice of features before making the purchase?"
"Yeah, it's been a good car so far, but most cars are pretty reliable at first.	What kind of car is it. I never liked buying cars because you spend so much time getting them."
"I have an amazing husband who is always there for me no matter what	I'm so lucky! How long have you two be together?"
"He was my sisters, husbands roomate in college and he came down for their wedding and we met there.  I can't imagine my life without him	That's great! I'm glad he was there for you!"
"One time I went to my friends 16th birthday party.  When I was walking in her house I ran smack into their glass door.  It was so clean that I didn't see it.	Oh my! How clean it really was! I'm guessing you didn't see it, or maybe you didn't see who she lived with? Either way, pretty unlucky."
"LOL..just my pride.  I was mortified and the funny part is that later on I won the door prize	That is the best part of that,  I bet that was so embarrassing"
"My husband and I are planning a big trip to Washington,DC	That's going to be so much fun! Do you have any family there?"
"I really want to go to the Smithsonian.  I love history and can't wait till we get to go	That's awesome! I live in MD but when we get to go to Virginia it makes plans a little easier to make! What are you planning on seeing there?"
"I have this knife that I carry everyday. My dad gave it to me before he died.	That is so sweet of him!  I'm sure he appreciated it!"
"It is, it's like he's always with me.	I'm so sorry to hear about your father's passing. That's an incredible knife to have!"
"I have many health problems that have prevented me from having children	I'm sorry to hear that.  I assume that you're trying to have children in a way that's sustainable."
"If I can get my health under control I would definetly look into that.  I use to be very sad everytime I saw people with their children but I have finally learned to be content in my situation	That's good. Children are a big investment which you should be very worried about."
"I had a job interview that was very important to me once	Nice. Did you think the interview went well?"
"yes, I prepared as best I could and I really felt that I aced it!  Sure enough I ended up getting the jon	Congrats! What job did you get?!"
"I used to live out of my car and it made me feel pretty down on myself back then	I am glad you are feeling better about yourself now."
"What types of situations? And yeah it could have been worse but I'm glad I'm out of it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that! I've never lived out of mine but I know I know I'm not superman like most people"
"Skydiving taught me how to let go and stop trying to fix everything	wow. You must be quite experienced with this subject"
"Yeah the hardest part for me was just realizing that I wouldn't be in control, but it was very natural in the end	wow that must be so difficult to let go of all of that fix you just gave"
"It's like something you have to figure out with your heart, kind of like how caterpillars have to stop trying to do a bunch of work so they can become butterflies	I ended up watching all the Robin William movies I could think of last weekend.	Really? How old were they and were they good? lol"
"I don't know if there is one of my favorites, but it sure was a lot of good memories.	I love those movies. His movies always make me feel like I'm getting older!"
"I was in a rush this morning and didn't realize I had put on two different colored sox.	Oh no! Were you able to change right away?"
"One was pink the other was green. I hope no one noticed.	No they didn't, that is hilarious. Well at least no one called you out on it, thats good! lol"
"I have been working on my dance moves for the last 6 months.	Are you a dancer?"
"Well its for a dance off, so it's a pretty big deal I have to win this.	Wow, that takes a lot of hard work! Good luck!"
"This one time my pants fell down in public, but I was really tired so I didn't realize	Oh no. Did anyone notice?"
"A couple minutes later	Were they unzipped or did you have some sort of medical emergency"
"Going in for an interview had me wondering what would happen	What are the questions for?"
"I decided not to take the job in the end, I guess I just wanted to know I could get it	Sometimes you need a gut feeling like you might get the job done. Did it work out for you?"
"I appreciate the place where I started cuz it helps me keep going	That's really good that it's there for you to stay on top of things like that."
"For sure, it reminds me that things are always getting better	That's good! It's hard to stay motivated sometimes when everything feels like going against the grain sometimes."
"I have been working on at the track to get my sprint times faster1	How do you feel like it is helping?"
"No, just me, but my 100 yard dash is so so slow, I can't even get lower than 6 seconds.	Sounds like a challenge! How long do you train?"
"I think I'm just really bad, maybe I will always be slow.	Slowpoke you are!  Do you try yoga or home runs?"
"Drinking a gallon of milk everyday makes me feel like an absolute madman in the gym who's gonna take over the world	That's quite an avid hobby, you must have a lot to be happy about.  Do you drink milk everyday?"
"That's not the point, gotta do it RAW	That's the point!  Don't you get it?!  You're making the protein for your muscles so it feels good to look and look and do things!  Do it without the milk, that's bad..."
"I had this juicy pump at the gym from doing some benching and it felt too easy	Nice! Sounds like you're lifting hard!"
"My pecs were poppin	Nice! I have worked out before but never on a machine."
"I was hurrying around the house and wasn't paying attention fully, I ending up hitting my toe on my dogs toys.	Ooof. Did you hurt them?"
"It really hurt, I think I may need to take all his toys away to punish him.	Oh no that is so painful, is he ok though?"
"I was at my main girls house and I saw these texts from this guy named Chad	Oh, what did chad say to that?"
"Yeah, I demoted her to my dinner girl, now I gotta choose who my main ting is gonna be	Oh, that's awkward. I hope you can make up your decision, though! You seem upset about it, but you probably already decided."
"I got mad because I was too full to finish my plate at the buffet	Did you finish?"
"Chinese, but no I decided not to, don't think would allow it	What were you eating at the buffet?"
"I spent 20 dollars on a piece of cheese cake.	cheese cake? what? is that like the gouda cake?"

"I have been working on my bench press for 6 months, I know I can get to bench 400 pounds.	Wow, you must be very strong."
"Steak and Maximum effort. I also drink lots of water, I'm on the next level like Arnold.	What are you waiting for to eat?"
"Paranormal activity is the sCaRiEsT movie of horror movies	I've heard of that, is it by Cameron?  Do you like it?  I didn't like it too much as a kid"
"Yeah you'll have to show me sometime	I've never heard of it, but my friends and I always watch.  Is it good?"
"I just gave up smoking cigarettes. It was pretty hard, but the worst part is how everything puts you on edge and it is hard to relax.	Smoking definitely can make you lose your temper and it definitely can be addictive to some level.. so I understand that. But it's better for everyone to do that than to be miserable and in a bad way. It will be a process for sure, but you got to start from a beginning."
"I closed my eyes and visualize a world where anything was possible. I called this world IMAGINATION land.	Wow that's actually a pretty interesting place to visualize... where everything is possible?  Congrats! How'd you do that?"
"I was challenged to a dare by my best friend!	Did you get the job?"
"No, the challenge was I had to spend the night in a cemetery. No flashlight no tents just a rolled up sleeping bag.	Oh wow! That sounds challenge enough to me!"
"I enjoy getting things done	What kind of things do you do?"
"I like to crochet and pay the bills	Oh really, you have skills."

"I was going through my photos today and I saw a picture of me and my ex together. It just made me feel odd, I miss him.	I'm sorry that it did that. Do you talk often?"
"We broke up back in May, he was just too much of a workaholic.	I'm so sorry. That's so sad. I hope it wasn't too painful of a break up for you."
"I get pretty sad some nights, but it feels good to cry sometimes	Crying helps us discover new areas in our lives"
"Yeah, sometimes it's like a deep sadness comes out of nowhere	I've never cried that much.  Are you depressed, or just sad?  It helps to remember life isn't fair."
"I had just been returning home, and on the side of the road there was some roadkill. It used to be a deer.	Eww! Sounds so gross! What did you do to it?"
"Yeah but my widows were down, and I could almost taste the stench of decay.	Oh my goodness! I could imagine the smell would be horrible!"
"Sometimes it's impossible to shove more food down my gullet	I'm right there with you! How long have you been eating this food, man? I can relate...my husband refuses to clean up after himself even though I tell him it's the least I can do for him lol."

"All of the puppies survived, truly a lucky amazing occasion!	Congratulations! That is so awesome!  litter box disasters are the worst."
"I was totally caught off guard as a kid when the entire yard was covered in Easter eggs	That's always a fun surprise! Did you go often?"

"My dog got hit by a car.	Oh man! Is he okay?"
"Yeah. He didn't survive. I really miss him	That is terrible, I'm sorry for your loss"

"My stomach made a loud noise while I was in class taking a test	Uh oh, did you find out what was it?"
"I just pretended like nothing happened, but i'm worried everyone thinks it was something other than my stomach	Uh oh! What was it?"
"I felt pretty good leaving the gym today, hit a new PR on overhead press	That's awesome! I love to hear that!"
"I like to try my hardest!	That's awesome! What do you do for that?"
"I felt like I could do anything after I finished meditating	That's great! What do you do to mediate?"

"Probably half a year, been the most consistent in my life, how about you?	I love going to the gym too. What do you like to do on it?"
"It's tough to talk to my parents, but I try to talk about things we don't disagree on	Parents can be so intimidating at times. I'm glad you worked it out."
"Anything political or religious really, or relationships	I am right there with you on that one"
"I had my dog for 13 years before she passed away last year from cancer. It was devastating!	That is so sad."

"I know, I just really miss her. Poor cancer kitty. I loved her so much.	That's terrible, I'm sorry. animals are so precious!"
"MY roommate got a new cat last week, and we finally let them meet today. I was so nervous and worried about it.	Oh wow. That's a big cat! What breed is it?"

"I'm not even sure what to do with all this time! I guess I should relax or have some leisure time, but everything in me says to try and be productive even on break. It's that school mentality.	Try to relax during the week and get out of your comfort zone during the school semester!"
"My sister came to visit from out of state. It was the first time we've seen her in nearly a decade!	What an awesome surprise! I bet she was so surprised to see you!"

"If I'm being honest, I made an answer key from the quizzes we took this semester. As they say, work smart, not hard.	That is very wise advice. Hard work always pays off."
"My cousin was swinging recklessly on my hammock and ended up breaking it!	Oh no! How young is he/she? I hope he/she was just clumsy."
"I was very upset, especially considering how long it took me to get it set up. I loved laying in my peaceful hammock to read.	Oh damn! That's not cool at all!"
"I received a phone call the other day from a friend I hadn't heard from in ages.	Well, that's good to hear! Did you call him up to make a phone call?"
"We reminisced about old times. It was very nice, indeed. It was nice hearing from him, especially during some rough times!	It's always nice to get a chance to reminisce about the good ole times! Are you guys still friends?"
"I have a weekend of nothing but relaxation planned for this weekend.	nothing better than relaxing! nothing can stop me from doing that!"
"I have some leftover roast in the fridge so I don't even have to leave the house. I'm going to watch a lot of netflix and MAYBE do a little laundry.	Sounds like the ultimate plan!  You're a genius!  I would have totally done the same."
"I keep having these dreams that I am out in public and somehow my clothes disappear. It's awful.	that is horrible i'm sorry you have that nightmare!"
"I hate those dreams, I feel anything but free. They're really uncomfortable and make me nothing but a ball of negative emotions like anxiety as I spend the majority of the dream trying to find clothes and get away from people.	I'm sorry you're having these dreams and it can't get better. Have you thought about getting therapy?"
"One of my friends recently bought a house. I really wish I could afford a house.	I'm sorry, I know how that feels. I recently bought my first home, only about 6 miles away. I think its even worse that you can't even buy groceries or clean your house."
"I'm starting to feel like I will never be able to afford a house. They're just so expensive. And the market has been going up here about 5% a year for the past 10 years.	I'm in the exact same boat. My friend just bought a place and has yet to sell, which makes me feel even more stressed."
"I ended up staying at home for the holidays	Sounds nice"
"No all my family lives out of state. I didn't feel like traveling, but I just ended up sitting at home and watching lord of the rings in the dark.	That sounds really awesome! What are some of your favorite movies?"
"I bumped into a friend from middle school. We chatted for a while	That sounds really cool! Did you guys catch up or get to do stuff?"
"Before 9th grade. I moved away that summer. Seeing her brought back a lot of good memories	I am glad it brought back some memories"
"I had a doctors appointment at 9 am and they kept me waiting for almost 2 hours.	Oh wow. What happened?"
"It was terrible I ended being late for work because of their horrible service.	I am sorry to hear that! They sound very rude and it seems your boss didn't care that you were so inconvenient!"
"The past few months have been terribly rough, but I think I can say that they have made me stronger.	That is good to hear! I hope it doesn?Ât change anything!"
"Thank you. I hope that I can move forward and at least learn from these hardships.	I am glad you are learning from your past bad experience and moving forward"
"I really hate when people can't hold themselves accountable for their own actions and decisions.	I do not like either of those things"
"Absolutely. Yet, these people have a horrible way of twisting things in order to guilt you, even if you'd done nothing wrong! It's a very manipulating and confusing feeling.	I agree. Its really frustrating and annoying when a person pretends to be innocent until proven guilty"
"I received a very odd message today. It came from a person who I blocked online, but they managed to find a loophole and messaged me by way of an inactive group.	Wow, that's strange. What was it that they found?"
"They were just trying to find ways to contact me. I have literally blocked them on all social media. It seems borderline stalkish, and it makes me very anxious.	I would confront them about it if i was you!"
"I'm going rock climbing with some friends!	That's awesome! I'm not even supposed to be able to rock climb!"
"I have done some climbing indoors for practice, but never done a big climb out doors, so who know how it will go.	That sounds like so much fun, but I would freak if I were in your position. I am terrified of even the smallest things!"
"I keep having these really weird nightmares at night.	Oh, that's awful! What happens during the night?"
"I'm usually in a big city that I'm familiar with, and roam around in the dream until I get stalked, jumped, and sometimes very hurt.	I am so sorry you had dreams like that. Have you thought of going to a therapist to help you deal with these issues?"
"Today I was quite impressed with my endurance during my work out. A few months ago, I couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs without losing my breath.	thats great"
"I sure have, but it's such hard work. I make sure to work out, even on the days that I don't want to. It's definitely taken a lot of will power.	You sound so motivated! I would be if I was as ripped as you!"
"I had a high risk pregnancy up until a few months ago. I felt the most grateful I'd ever been when my baby turned out healthy.	That is wonderful! I am so happy that your pregnancy was successful! I am having a girl soon!"
"It was a really rough pregnancy that ended with a very painful surgery. It was not pretty, but definitely worth it. I would have taken any amount of pain as long as my son was born healthy and safe.	I'm pleased to hear. You must be a very sentimental person."
"I just learned my first trick in ice skating, a triple spin twirl kick front flip.	Wow that's pretty cool!"
"I never thought I would have the balance to perform such a feat. I think I can no qualify for the Olympics.	Wow! that is quite the trick! You must be quite proud of yourself!!"
"I just started college again, and while I'm doing great in school, it has lead me to feel very lonely with a lack of social life.	I can understand where you're coming from. Start hanging out with people more often and try and make friends where you are. You'll make friends where you'll fit in, I'm sure."
"That sound like a good idea if they weren't online classes. Next semester I have a few on campus courses, so I'm hoping I'll be able to make at least one new friend.	You can always make new ones online! Start making friends with your friends!"
"This upcoming semester will be my first time taking 5 classes at once. I'm pretty worried that I may have taken on too much.	You'll be okay. Just make sure to have a lot of breaks. What are you majoring in?"
"I'm not sure. The more I think about it, the more I doubt myself. I also have a baby, so I'm hoping I'll be able to juggle everything at once.	You will do great I am sure!"
"I adore my girlfriend. I am getting very serious about not leaving her side.	What do you think is the issue that you are having with your girlfriend?"
"Thank you. Do you have a romantic interest?	No, I don't have any romantic interest."
"Summer in the South calls for many unwanted visitors of the insect type!	Yes indeed! The bugs that gather all around us in the summers are a real danger! What are you going to do about them?"
"Mosquitoes, and those dreadful flying ants. They're everywhere!	I'm so glad I'm not as scared of those as you are."
"Lately I've felt proud of my success as a newly single mother. It gets lonely sometimes, but I can honestly say I've been doing everything I can and more.	I am happy that you are doing well"
"Thank you! I definitely have a drive to feel strong for them. I hope some day they can realize my efforts.	It's a difficult situation to be in but I'm really there for you."
"I have a plethora of amazing friends. One of mine recently drove me from Georgia to South Florida	That's awesome!  How long were you guys driving"
"It is an 8 hour drive! Florida is a very long state	That must've been quite a journey for you all!"
"I recently totaled my car. There were no injuries but I feel absolutely terrible	Oh no. That's awful! I hope you had good insurance."
"It was very wet and I took a turn at too high of a speed.	That's no good, are you ok?"
"My mom and I haven't always had the best relationship. Recently I've had to tell myself to let her in more. It's been challenging.	That's hard. It sounds like you're trying hard to give the best to her, but she's probably reading it back at you. How has it been going, though?"
"Thank you. I know that, even though it's challenging, I need to be patient in order to improve our relationship.	Patience is very helpful, I'm glad you have a way to improve your relationship.  I'm sure it has it's advantages too.  How are things with your partner?"
"I have had the toughest time getting my pet rat to get along with others. She's always been very aggressive!	Have you taught her to be more friendly with other rats?"
"She's never bitten anyone, thankfully, but she gets crazy with other rats. To my surprise though, I've recently found her snuggling with the others she usually tries to fight!	That's amazing! I'm glad it's working out for you."
"This past month, I was able to visit Six Flags!	Thats awesome! I love Six Flags! What did you ride?"
"It was amazing. The last time I was at an amusement park had to have been over a decade ago!	Thats awesome! I love taking my kids there."
"The other day I noticed my pet has a growth on her lower belly. I fear it may be a tumor.	I hope it isn't! Have you talked to your vet about it?"
"She's a rat, so her body is very frail. I'm sad that she likely will not make it. She's been with me through thick and thin.	Oh no!  Have you thought of getting a second cat?"
"I let the girl of my dreams slip away. Now I am alone.	That is a terrible thing to happen.  You must feel terrible about it!"
"I hope so. I think that time heals all wounds.	Oh no. You must feel terrible. How did she say that?"
"I recently went to the pool and lost my suit. My trunks were in the water without me!	Oh no! That must've been horrible!"
"I was not, unfortunately. People saw everything!	Oh man that sucks! Did you get them back?"
"I let a romantic interest slip through my fingers. She's now with somebody that I despise	I'm sorry. I hope she comes back to earth."
"I think so. I have plenty of time and life goes	Don't be nervous. She's your bestfriend after all."
"I feel great right now. I have a new album coming out and it feels liberating to be done!	Oh nice! I'd love to have a new music sound like yours! What kind of music do you listen to?"
"I am very excited. It is almost an hour and a half long	What kind of music do you like to listen to?"
"I can't wait to travel. I am going to Madagascar soon!	Oh man! I've heard it's quite fascinating!"
"I have! I actually grew up in Saudi Arabia	Wow, I've never heard of that. When do you go?"
"The world is savage. I believe that the right individuals can take us to a better place in the future	I agree. I think we are in the right place at the right amount."
"I think so too. There are some kind and great people in the world	You know what they call a tude?"
"I went walking in the woods one night. It was pretty scary out there	Really scary?  Were you alright?"
"No, everything was fine, but it was a chilling experience	Oh yeah? I've been to that place a few times. You were scared at least?"
"I caught my dog trying to eat my nephew's dirty diaper that my brother left on the couch	haha funny how that works. Did your brother say something?"
"It was really gross. I had to keep my dog from licking my face for a long time after that.	That's disgusting. Did your brother notice?"
"I recently remembered a sweet memory of my aunt who recently passed away.	Oh that's sad to here of. Sorry for the loss. Was this recently?"
"She would give hundreds of dollars of school supplies to kids in need each year.	Oh, that's so sweet! What a wonderful memory. It's wonderful how memories like that are repeated so vividly in our lives."
"She did! I fill stockings around the holidays and go around on Christmas giving them out to people who have to work. :)	thats awesome! what a nice person!"
"My daughter and her family are coming this Thanksgiving. I'm already preparing for their visit.	Oh, wow!  I bet that will be so fun!!  What do you have planned?!"
"Not too much, just really exciting. I'm planning everything even though it's months away, even the menu.	What are you cooking up for the family?"
"My mother in law was recently placed in hospice and is not expected to live much longer.	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.  My mother-in-law was placed in hospice recently too - she's not going to make it.  What happened?"
"She's 87, so she has lived a long life, but she has Alzheimers, and it's really sad to watch her lose her mind.	That is horrible. I feel so bad for her and her family"
"That's a great way of looking at it. I should try to keep a positive attitude towards it.	It is really difficult to deal with someone with an Alzheimers. She is lucky to have a great partner in life though."
"I was driving home from out of town really late one night and was exhausted	Sounds like you got reallyDrizzled! Did you have to uber?"
"I did get home safe but it was scary because the roads were two lane and lots of 18-wheelers were heading in the opposite direction. I kept thinking I would swerve into their lane and collide into them	I can't stand driving in busy roads! I try to only drive when there is nobody around"
"I've been trying to be extra supportive towards my husband.	How does he deal with it?"
"Yes - so true. His mom is dying, and he is working long hours on top of it. I feel really bad for him.	That is so sad to hear. I am really sorry to hear that. I hope he gets well soon."
"My friend who I haven't seen in a long time came to visit. She married a very wealthy man and I was a bit envious	It's natural that people want to meet people. I would feel the same way!"
"She drove up in a fancy car and seems like she doesn't have a care in the world. I wish that were me some days.	I feel you man. It feels good to be loved."
"I was at a get together recently and a friend's husband was flirting with me.	What happened then? Did he start something new?"
"I didn't know what to say to her, and was afraid she wouldn't believe me and it would cause her to be angry at me. It's a bad situation.	I would tell the husband if she said no take the blame."
"When I was in second grade, I wet my pants in the middle of class.	Oh, man, I hope you didn't get embarassed"
"I know! I was super afraid of my teacher, and was scared to ask her to go to the bathroom.	Oh man. That's super gross, but that is the story for me, too."
"She was really mean and always yelling! I didn't want her to yell at me. I'm much older and wiser now!	I want to trick my butler into thinking he won the lottery. I've taped the local new's winning lottery numbers and I'm going to buy a ticket with the same numbers and give it to my butler	ohh, thats so sweet. You are making my mouth water!"
"I'm not sure he likes being the target of pranks, but he likes to prank me and this prank is to get back at him for a prank he pulled on me and my cousin	What are the numbers?"
"My friend just took her kids to Disneyland and I feel a little bad about it.	Disneyland? why would you feel bad? that's a wonderful holiday"
"I'd been wanting to do that trip with my kids for years. I'm happy for her- just wish it could have been me.	Disneyland is so fun! I went there as a child and as an adult I loved it. Maybe you should try and do it with your kid too! Haha!"
"I won a trip to Washington D.C. a few years ago	How cool! How long did you have to stay for?"
"I had a blast. I met people from all over the country, visited many historical sites, and learned a lot about how government works	That sounds really amazing! How did it make you feel when you were going to Washington?"
"I'm looking forward to my best friend's surprise birthday party next week!	You sound excited about that, are you?"
"I'm really happy about it- she's a great friend and she's turning 40, so it's a big one!	That's awesome! She's a lucky lady!"
"About 20 friends, surprising her at her favorite bar after work.	My 25th high school reunion is coming up and I'm excited.	Oh, that sounds fun! Have you been looking forward to it for a long time, or are you just excited to get out and meet some of y'all again?"
"Honestly? There was this girl who really treated me poorly - I can't wait for her to see how successful I have been!	Wow. I'm sure she felt bad for awhile but I bet she was proud."
"A hurricane hit my city. The first night I thought the wind was going to tear the roof off the house	Oh my, I am glad you are ok!!"
"It was my third. Luckily we didn't lose power for more than a few hours	Oh no! Is everyone ok, is your city lucky? Did any damage to your house?"
"It damaged the roof and the fence. We lost power for six days during the first hurricane I experienced	Man that's awful, I hope you didn't get much damage. What hurricane was it?"
"I am loyal to my principles, that is why I do not eat meat, because I love life	That is a good reason to stay faithful."
"If I already have 10 years of vegetarian	That's a good reason.  vegetarianism is a life long decision."
"I healthy physically and spiritually	My daughter recently broke curfew by three hours!	Wow, thats pretty bad... Did you give her a make over?"
"I was super angry, yes! I ended up grounding her for three weeks- one week for each hour she was late.	I would have grounded too! Kids can be such drunks!"
"I have a certification exam coming up and I think I'll do well.	What is it for?"
"I think so- I've studied quite a bit with my husband and others.	That's good. Hopefully, you will do great on it."
"Education- teaching license certification	Hello ... I confess that when I see my daughter's eyes, my heart suffers.	Why is that?? is she looking away??"
"They are sick	Aww I'm sorry. That's sweet"
"Relax, they are things that happen	My new manager gave me a pay-rise!	How nice of him. Did he give you a raise that big?"
"I feel very grateful that he has been so generous.	Wow that's great! You must be feeling quite happy about the situation!"
"My partner left me the other day.	I'm so sorry to hear that.  What happened?"
"That's fine, its not your problem. i just feel very lonely right now.	I'm so sorry. That's awful. Have you tried talking to anyone about how you feel?"
"I just moved to a new city and I don't know anyone	You should have a friend over and make new connections!"
"Yeah, it's hard though. I hate to go out by myself. It's hard for me to meet new people	I understand that completely, I have been in a similar situation, I have a friend in San Francisco and it's a pretty big city too, so I understand how you feel! Keep your head up - you are doing something right if you have people to confider you!"
"I took my final exams a few weeks ago and I was sure I had done well, but I failed.	Oh no what happened"
"I don't know what happened. I studied and passed everything else. Now I have to retake the class and I'm upset	That's a shame. I'm sure everything went well in the end. You should celebrate by going out for drinks on the weekends."
"My sister kept playing a few seconds of a song over and over again on her laptop last night. Now it's stuck in my head.	shes a lucky lady"
"It drives me bonkers when she does that	That is crazy! I hope she took it somewhere to be saved. Maybe on an SD or something?"
"I saw these 4-color Bic pens in the store the other day. I remember when I was young and getting one was like Christmas morning!	oh yeah? what were they like then?"
"Yes! My mom used to always get me one each year before school started. Those were the coolest pens in the world!	Oh I remember those. I had an extra set of Bic pens that I used when I was in middle school and found out I didn't have the real kind"
"I'm optimistic that my house is going to sell soon.	How soon are you expecting to sell it?  Are you anticipating a big increase in the asking price?"
"Only a week- and 17 people have seen it already, so I'm feeling good about it selling quickly!	That's a lot of people, did you see it recently?"
"My best friend was going to travel from Wisconsin to see my this summer, but she ended up not being able to come.	That's a shame. Did she reschedule?"
"Nothing- I still haven't seen her. I felt pretty let down - but hopefully I can make the trip to see her soon.	I'm sorry. That's always disappointing. Hopefully you can make the trip at some point in the future."
"My sister threw up the other day and made a huge mess.	That is nasty. What did she do to cause it? Was it a diaper rash?"
"Fortunately no- she cleaned it up. But she had just had spaghetti and it was floating in it. It was so gross!	That sounds disgusting!  My sister would make me feel sick just because she can do things like that!  What did she do?  Is she sick?"
"I was livid when I went to work the other day and saw my car was broken in to	Did anything happen or was it just the mechanic giving you a hard ride?"
"I heard it was happening in other areas but didn't expect it here because we live in a nice neighborhood. So frustrating	Sorry to hear that! That's awful, what did you have to fix it?"
"Every year when the kids go back to school, it brings back so many memories of when my kids were going to school.	How many memories do you have of when your kids were in school?"
"I would cry the first day of school every year, especially the milestone years. Now my grandchildren are starting school. Time flies by too quickly	i agree!"
"So everyone is gone form the house and i found a thing of thin mints, and I ate the whole thing for breakfast.	What did you eat for this breakfast?"
"LOL, I swear it was like I sat down and they were gone!  Probably gave myself diabetes. So not going to be able to eat the rest of the day!	Omg! I have done that more than once, I feel bad."
"Sigh, I have no self control, definatley need a veggie or two today now! Probably should knix those form the pantry	My father passed away in November, it's made me feel empty ever since.	oh no. i am so sorry to hear about that."
"I didn't think it would hit me hard. I felt like I was prepared.	im sorry to hear about that, im sure it has hit you hard but keep the faith that everything works out for the best"
"I surprised my girlfriend with Chik-Fil-A breakfast this morning when she got off work.	OMG! I would be SO stunned! How did you react? I bet it was really crowded!"
"She works nights, and had no idea I was coming. I knew she had a bad night so I wanted to do something nice for her.	Oh that's sweet! I love chik fil-a breakfast! It's just so convenient and quick to get to work."
"I recently was laid off from my job. I haven't found anything yet, but I'm trying to stay positive that I will soon.	I'm so sorry! I hope soon things start looking positive for you.  I know it's probably tough right now, but I'm so confident in God's goodness!  And He'll bless all of you."
"I keep looking and applying, but still here I sit. I know it will happen when the right one comes along though	It's really a pity that you're in that position right now!  I hope you'll get the good news soon!"
"I lost the book that my friend let me borrow. I feel so embarrassed.	What book was it?"
"I'm trying to find a new one, but this one was rare and hard to find.	ah that stinks.. what book was it?"
"My birthday was last week and I never heard from my brother OR my sister to wish me a happy birthday.	Oh, I'm so sorry! I""m so sorry! Did your family not invite you?"
"I guess I shouldn't expect so much from them and let myself get let down like I have.	I am sorry to hear that. Did they say when you called them that they had heard from your sister yet?"
"The older I get, the more relaxed and just a simple happy and calm feeling I have. It is nice to just enjoy being alive.	It is nice to not have worry in life."
"Those examples are definitely the simple pleasures of life. It makes me want to go outside and listen to the birds and smell the flowers.	i agree with everything you just said"
"I went swimming the other day and when I jump into the water and came back up, my bathing suit top was pulled over my breast and I was wandering why everyone was staring at me.	Hahahaha I've done things like that. Did you laugh or were you embarrased?"
"Yes I did realize fairly fast why everyone was staring. I looked down and seen my breast exposed.	Oh no, were you able to laugh about it at all?"
"I think my cat likes my new girlfriend more than he likes me now.	How come?"
"Yea he loves to sit on my lap while i work, but prefers her side of the bed now when he sleeps.	That is weird."
"My grandfather passed away not too long ago, i received a bunch of items he left for me.	I'm sorry for the loss, I hope he was a good grandpa."
"Some interesting antiques, grandfather clocks, and a lot of items related to his work for the house of representatives. Interesting stuff	That's very nice of the representatives, they must have felt very sentimental"
"I had to let my dad borrow my car the other day. His truck is in the shop.	That was nice of him. Did he trust you not to take it?"
"Yeah it has. And, he took good care of my car, as always.	That's good that your dad is a good parent!"
"I ca not believe what happened the other night at my friends house, I'll never show my face again.	What happened?"
"Sure, I fell asleep on the chair and had a dream, in my dream I went to the restroom, so yeah, I peed right there in their chair.	That's pretty messed up.  I hope you didn't wake them up in the morning and have them telling the whole truth to what you said."
"Yes, it was not fun, but good to know I am not the only one.	I enjoy helping the wildlife in my area where I live. I give them a helping hand. I give them water, birdseed, my left over food. The animals love watermelon and cantaloupe.	That's really sweet! You sound like a great friend to these guys!"
"I just have the small non dangerous type of wildlife that I like to help Birds, rabbits, squirrels and such. No big bad bears!	That sounds like a wonderful thing for them to enjoy. It sounds like you really love helping them."
"We got a new puppy! We took him in from our father in law.	Oh how cute! What breed?"
"Its a long hair chihuahua and a short hair chihuahua. He has the most adorable under bite!	That's awesome!  I love dogs, so that's what caught me off guard.  How long did you have him for?  Is he small now?"
"I found out my wife was having an affair, the worst part is i knew the guy and welcomed him in my home and was kind to him.	Wow, that is a big shock!  How did you feel when you found out!?"
"I'm learning to live my live without her, it's tough. Some honesty would have made the way it ended much better. Thanks for the kind words.	That is terrible. I feel really bad that my wife would do something like that."
"I went on a soda fast for two days so that I could pray for strength for my husband while he tried to quit smoking. I am addicted to soda so it was hard. I made it though and I was able to pray for him multiple times during the two days.	Soda is addicting to some extent. How did he quit?"
"Yeah me too. The lack of caffeine made me get a bad headache that took three days to get rid of.	That is really impressive! It is hard to quit cigarettes, I am surprised that you were able to get through."
"No, they suck!!	I recently had an argument with a friend. Even though I talked ot her about it and let her know how I felt, my daughter overheard me discussing it with my husband. She thought I was being two faced, which lead to a long discussion. I felt guilty even though I didn't do anything wrong.	I'm glad it didn't lead to anything too bad"
"Yeah, I just felt like I set a bad example for my daughter, even thought she misunderstood. I guess it was a teachable moment though..	Sometimes it's hard to tell if someone is being honest and understandable. It could be they're being cruel or it could be they're just being self-aware. Either way, I hope everything works out in the end somehow."
"That's good advice. Thanks!	I found huge box full of my old cd's recently, found a ton of old pc games i used to play, reminded me of a simpler time!	That sounds like it would be fun to go through and find some more good ones to play with, maybe some old siblings can play with you? lol"
"I did, i played a few sessions of age of empires and i plan to play some command and conquer red alert tonight before bed, still great games.	I've never heard of Red alert, but I love those kind of games! Sounds like fun."
"I got turned down for a job I really wanted.	Oh no! That's not cool. I am sure that you deserved the turn though."
"Thanks.  But yes, I was really dejected.  I thought I'd interviewed well and had a good enough resume.	That is really frustrating. I am sure there is another position open.  Did they give you a reason?"
"When my wife left me, i felt worthless and like giving up on life to be honest, I've since started making some positive changes and and more optimistic	I know the feeling. Sometimes you got to make those changes to keep yourself moving forward."
"Well, Like the saying goes, get busy living or get busy dying. I'm not sure if i'll ever find someone i truly love but life goes on!	I can relate... Getting busy in life can be very hard but it can also be incredibly rewarding as well."
"I bought a 20 foot boat. I believe it will be able to handle the large lake that I will be taking it on.	That sounds like it would be fun! Have you been river walking before?"
"It cost me around $30,000. It has all the latest features, that should keep me safe in all but the most extreme conditions.	That is amazing.  Where did you buy that?"
"It has been a dream of mine for a long time. I am mainly going to use it for fishing. But might have to take my wife tubing to make her happy.	That's amazing! I hope you're able to afford that for your wife!"
"We should have a lot of fun this summer with it! Makes up for all the hard work saving up for it.	That's awesome, I'm so jealous. Hopefully when it is time for it for you that you can take some fun photos"
"I like like loaning money to friends. It can ruin friendships and sometimes doesn't get paid back.	I do too actually."
"Yeah, I meant don't like, sorry. I recently lent some to my friend with no expectation of getting it back because of her hard situation. I actually got it back.	That was very generous of you. You must have a very good friend"
"Last summer, my dog went missing. We looked for him everywhere and called all of our neighbors. No one had seen him.	Oh that's terrible! I'm so sorry! How long has it been?"
"After a week of looking for him and checking the shelters, a neighbor found his body under her house. He had gotten under there and couldn't find a way out. I was so heart broken and so were my daughters.	I'm so sorry to hear that. I love dogs."
"I try to skateboard with my kids everyday. They love it, and it makes me feel young again.	It's great to have family out there pushing you harder. That said, if I didn't have family pushing me, I'd probably not like it as much as you do :)"
"It can be scary some times, but its worth it.	That is amazing! I wish I could be like that with my kids, I feel like that would be paradise."
"My daughters 6th birthday was recently, unfortunately her mothers side of the family didn't show up, even though they all rsvp'd	Aw that sucks. Did they have another plan?"
"Hah yea, she was sad at first but there was plenty of presents and people who love her around to distract her. They grow up fast.	That is sad."
"The other week, a friend of mine told me there was an opening where he worked and to get him a resume. I took to long to get my resume together and they gave the job to someone else.	Oh no! I hate when that happens, but I hope everything turned out alright."
"It would have been nice. Less pay, but I would have had to work less. Oh well, guess I'll try harder next time.	You'll get it next time, friend."
"The other day I was running late. So, I jumped up and threw on some clothes then ran out of the house.	Did you get in an accident or did someone hit you?  Did the police catch you?"
"I did but when after I was out for a while I noticed the shirt I was wearing was covered in grease stains. I apparently washed it with my husbands work clothes.	That is hilarious and terrible! hahahaha"
"I have MS, and sometimes I have bowl problems.	Have you gone to a doctor to see what might be causing this"
"No, I've tried science remedies. I like those kinds better.	What do people usually put in those repair vacuums?"
"My son got a remote control car for his birthday. Its really cool.	Oh cool! What kind of car?  Does he like driving it?"
"No, his grandpa did. But, after he went to bed, I went outside and played with it for a while.	What a cool surprise! What kind of car?  Did it work or anything?"
"Someone broke into my car the other day, but they didnt steal anything.	Oh wow. Did they catch the guy?"
"I know! I feel both violated and kind of sad because I have nothing in my car worth stealing.	thats crazy! i hate that!"
"There was an elderly lady at my church who was blind and could not hear well so you had to talk really loud for her to hear you. She was very faithful about coming to church so our preacher picked her up and took her home for every service. When she needed help, we took turns helping her.	That is so wonderful!"
"When I saw that she needed help, I always tried to give her directions based on where she was with her walker. I liked helping her. She recently passed away and I miss her.	That's really sweet of you to be so there for her. You sound like a great presbyterian."
"Yes, she loved everyone she met. She would say she couldn't remember everyone's names, but she loved them anyway.	I took my son to kindergarten the other day. He loves it so far!	That's awesome! You're setting an example, I hope he sticks with it!"
"You bet! He made a girlfriend on the bus by talking about Zelda.	Wow, Zelda must be one of the best video games of all generation!"
"Lately, my family and I have been very blessed. We are all happy and healthy. All of our major bills have already been paid for the month, and we have been going to a three week long revival at a local church.	That sounds awesome!  Congrats!  What do you do to keep yourself and your family busy?"
"We have just been trusting in the Lord.	That is awesome, I am glad to hear that."
"Thank you.	I was looking at some old pictures of my kids' first day of school from 4 years ago.	Were you looking at the wrong photos? lol"
"It just gave me the feeling that time flies by too quickly sometimes.  My youngest in the pic was in first grade and his older sister was in 7th grade.	Its a great feeling to look back on the days gone by"
"And tons of pics!  I try to take pictures of everything.	I couldn't believe Aretha Franklin passed away last week.	Aretha Franklin died a long time ago, she was a singer."
"Sometimes you think people will be around forever, their aura is just so...legendary.	Aretha Franklin passed away?  That's a pretty interesting statement.  I haven't heard that yet actually"
"I just finished eating dinner.  We had red beans and rice and with sausage.  I'm as full as a tick!	That sounds delicious."
"I had to soak them for 3 hours.  I think that's what makes that meal so satisfying - the wait!	Oh man, sausage rice is the bomb!"
"I do the same thing!	Found out some bad news today about my kids custody case.	Oh no! Is everything clear for you?"
"Yeah, it really is. Due to a technicality custody is reverting to their father.	That's really rough. It's hard for kids to have kids if they're in stressful circumstances."
"I think I aced my supervisor exam!	Thats awesome! Congratulations"
"I should know something by tomorrow morning.  Hopefully they tell me right away.	You did! I hope they don't cut you loose."
"I have all my kids' things ready for the first day of school tomorrow!	That's great. Are you going to surprise some one at the school or just see how well they do?"
"I think I am.  I tried to do as much in advance as I could.	Thats a good start.  Do you have a party?"
"My daughter is in 8th grade and just started school a little over a week ago. She is already being bullied.	That's really sad. Bullies are terrible!"
"Yes, and will again because it didn't help. I try to cheer her up with hugs, goofy moments, and whatever else I can think of.	It's tough to watch as an adult. It's hard to see how one kid is so mean to another. But it's good she is learning and making changes to protect herself and her family. So much better that she wasn't raised in a bad environment."
"I had a chance to cheat on my wife once,	By how much, if i may ask?  please tell me about this"
"I did not. I left there quickly. It was not something I would ever want to do.	Wow, that's brave of you! How'd things go?"
"My dog got very sick and lay in bed for a couple weeks.  I was so concerned.	Oh no! I hope he recover soon!"
"She did get better eventually.  During that time I tried to tend to her as much as I could.	I hope that you were able to do everything that you could to care for her."
"My roommate recently got a kitten, and he went out of town so I am watching over the little bugger.	Are you going to keep it?"
"I love cats, I have one of my own. I haven't been around a kitten in forever so it's a real treat. I also don't have to sleep with the little brat at night either so it's especially great.	Are you roommates a boy or a girl?"
"I had a solo competition last week for cello. I was well prepared and knew my music well. I felt great walking into that room.	Wow, cello must be really good! Did you win your competition?"
"I have been playing the cello for 5 years.	Wow, cello is a pretty complex music instrument! You must be very talented!"
"I slipped and feel at work the other day. Several people saw it. I wanted to just crawl in a hole and hide afterwards.	Oh wow! I'm so sorry! Did you feel humiliated?"
"Just my pride	Oh wow, I hope it wasn't serious!"
"My ex and I broke up because he decided that he would no longer be willing to leave his job from overwork, like 70 plus hours a week.	I am sorry, you seem to be broken up for good reasons.  How are you holding up?"
"He claims that he kept getting raises and felt obligated to work even harder. So he just kept working more and more and I rarely got to spend time with him and he was always tired.	I can see why it's so difficult for women to leave abusive men. You're absolutely right about his motivation. He doesn't have to make the decisions, but at least he's honest about making them. I hope you're getting out of the relationship, though. That speaks volumes to both about your personality and your"
"My ex recently said that he was wanting to get back together. I'm not sure how to feel about it, we've been getting along great since we broke up.	I'm sure he meant break ups usually last for a long time.  If you two are getting along well you should just keep doing it!"
"The straw that broke the camels back is that he broke a promise that he would leave his job if they were over working him too much. He decided he didn't want to leave after all and wants to keep working 70+ hour weeks every week.	That seems like a crazy reason to throw away the best guy. Maybe it's a smokeshow situation."
"I came home today and the food I had put in the crock pot was ruined. The outlet must have died and the food sat in there all day not cooking.	I hate when that happens! You should have taken pictures and posted on the web!"
"Yeah it was pretty terrible. I had to throw out a TON of food, and to add insult to injure I had to go eat out tonight.	That sucks! I would've been SO upset."
"I let my friend babysit my kid last week.	That was nice. Did he babysit your kid well?"
"Awesome. I usually have a hard time letting anyone watch my child but he had a great time with her.	That's awesome. How old is your friend?"
"5	Kids can be such good actors/ singers/models/eaters- I'm glad you were able to have a great time with your kid!"
"I was out walking by the lake over the weekend and there shore was just covered in dead rotting fish.	That's gross. Did you go straight for the shore or did you do it by yourself?"
"I don't know, that's what I would like to know! The best I can imagine is that the water quality dropped, and they died. I imagine it was pollution.	That must've been really gross, and sad to see."
"I have a really big game coming up this weekend. I haven't played soccer since I was a kid and have been really nervous about joining an adult league.	its never too late. You can sign up now and start training on friday."
"I just don't want to embarrass myself or my team. I'm so scared i'm going to make a fool of myself.	Just be confident in your ability! It's not like you have to do anything crazy to win the game!"
"Several years ago one of my neighbors dogs attacked me and I had to go to the hospital to get stitches.	What happened to your dog?"
"I had to get 2 stitches in one of the holes and 1 stitch and all the other holes. He was a big dog, a little over 50 pounds.	Oh that's a lot, did you have to have surgery?"
"Last year I made a bet with my friend and he lost, so he had to buy me a Nintendo Switch. I was so great.	Nintendo are known for having some of the best customer service in the world!"
"I made a bet that he would not lose 20 pounds in 3.5 months. I was hoping that he would win the bet, but on the bright side I got a switch :) Win-win for me.	That's a really good win!  What are you going to do with your Switch?"
"I am visiting my friend this week.	how long has it been since you last spoke with him?"
"Yes, I mean I promised her I would  and some things came up but I know I gotta stick to my word and make this happen.	That's good that you have a friend like her."
"Oh I know I can't. She had lots of plans for us.	One time when I was little and playing hide and go seek, my cousin talked me into remaining hidden even when our parents came looking for us. After a while I realized that we were going to be in trouble, and then we saw a police car pull into the drive way.	what happened after that? did he/she get you and what did he or she do?"
"Yeah I guess they were, they made sure to spank me and ground me for 2 weeks. I was also told that I was a terrible influence on my 9 year old cousin, even though I was 7 and it was his idea.	That's a real example of family versus an idea someone came up with. It sounds like you had a big influence and influenced your cousin for life!"
"So we are moving and I'm having trouble letting go of a sewing machine my grandma gave me. Thinking I should keep it.	Oh that's a cool gift. I'm sure it'll last you a long time!"
"Kind of just dust. It meant a lot to her that I have it so I just don't think I can let it go.	Maybe she will give it back to you as a gift?"
"One of my friends managed to pay off their first house at the age of 25.	That's pretty cool.  Did you guys celebrate?"
"Yeah I know, I'm really amazed and proud of him. To be honest as proud as I am I can't help but to be a little jealous too lol.	That's awesome. I wish I could do something cool like that."
"I stayed at a friends house for the weekend a while back, and when I got home my bedroom was destroyed	Whoa that's terrible! Did you at least get some security cameras?"
"My younger brothers went in my room and messed with all my things. I am so angry about it	Oh no. Did they damage anything else?"
"Today when I was home alone I was snuggling with a stuffed bunny my ex got me, because I missed him. I feel so pathetic.	hahaha I'm glad someone made a connection. You're not the only person who thought that, I've seen similar blankets pass by in passing. It could be that you are reconnecting with an old buddy."
"I hope so, I'm tired of feeling so miserable. I just wish I had someone here with me right now.	Maybe you will get lucky next time"
"My husband and I celebrated 9 years Saturday. It was such a good day of quality family time.	Awww, how nice of you! I'm still too young to understand how special that day was."
"Yes I love a good day of relaxation and family time :)	Thats awesome! Sounds like its a great day to be alive!"
"Yes, dinner :)	I went to the zoo last month, I haven't been since I was a kid. I went to a zoo that was supposed to be one of the top zoos, however I couldn't help but feel bad for the animals the whole time.	What zoo was it?"
"The enclosures all just seemed so tiny and it felt like none of the animals were able to have any privacy if they wanted it.	That sounds so sad and sad!"
"I won an essay contest and I get to go to Washington DC for free!	I'm so excited! How long will it be free?"
"I wrote about social security reform. Kinda boring stuff lol but it'll be fun to visit all the sites in DC	That is very exciting!  I can see why it'd be kinda boring though :)  Are you excited?"
"We are moving. I'm so pumped for new adventures.	Where are you moving?"
"Yes, a new state. I am just imagining all the fun things and new things we can do.	Where did you move?"
"When I was in middle school there was this boy that sat in front of me in 8th, he was always trying to get me to kiss him before class started.	What happened next"
"No, the whole thing was really weird and kind of embarrassing really. He sat in the desk in front and would turn around and basically ask me to kiss him in front of the whole class. I only knew him from that class. I usually would just smash my binder in his face instead.	Hahahahahah I would've been busy trying to figure out how to respond... But I'm glad it worked out for you."
"I've been out of a job for a while but someone I know has offered me an opportunity to do some work in my field	Well that's nice. Are you really interested in doing this?"
"Statistics. I am going to help a real estate company build models to predict house values	that's very kind of you to help them. are they hiring?"
"So a friend and I entered a drawing at the mall and she won. I wish I could say it doesn't sting a bit that she won.	That's awesome! I hope to win someday. What is the drawing for?"
"A weekend trip to Gatlinburg. I would of loved that.	What is gonville?"
"She is but she's taking her husband :)	I saw  man swallow a sword	Was it a dragon tooth?"
"Yes I was. I thought it was pretty intense to watch	What kind of sword it was?"
"I've been packing, packing, packing and cleaning.	Are you going to go on a vacation?"
"Moving, not sure when yet but I like to be  ahead of the game. I hate being rushed.	I love being organized and prepared! I think being organized and careful is so much better than being rushed."
"Someone hit my car while I was shopping. I am so mad they didn't even leave a note.	Oh no! Did you file a police report?"
"Huge dent, I can't believe someone could do that and drive off.	Oh my gosh! That's terrible! Was anyone else hurt? That's so dangerous! Hopefully, insurance covers your car -- if not, that's even worse! Were you able to claim any damage at all?"
"I remember back when I got to pick up my dog at the airport when she was a puppy.	Awww. I bet that was so special."
"Oh man, I sure was. And she was so excited to get out of that box.	That is a crazy memory. Did she remember you picked her up?"
"My brother isn't very good with money but i just lent him some	Is it a large amount? How much do you want for it?"
"Yeah I don't do that often, but i am certain he will be able to pay me back this time	That's good. Sometimes older money is better than new money."
"I just can't believe some people. I watched this woman throw her trash on a homeless man today.	wow thats horrible"
"I definitely stepped in and made sure this man knew he didn't deserve that. Just makes me so mad to share a country with people like that.	That trash man must have felt really bad. It's his turn to throw it though."
"So we are waiting on some news to move. I feel like it will be this week that we find out.	News about what?"
"Not sure yet, waiting to find all of that out. I hate waiting though.	I feel ya. Waiting is no fun! What's the news?"
"So I interviewed for my dream job last week and I didn't get it.	Oh man!  I'm so sorry!  What happened??"
"I really hope so. I was really wanting that job.	I'm sorry.  I hope it's not too bad."
"So I was driving to work yesterday and the driver next to me opened their door and threw up everywhere.	I would have lol"
"Yes they were at a stop light but I was so grossed out after seeing that.	Oh that's disgusting! I would have been so sick! I am so sorry!"
"I am so ready to find out where we are moving to.	Where to? tell me where and when!"
"I don't know where I want to go, just want to know where they are sending us :)	where are yall moving?"
"A book I borrowed from the library got rained on and now it's destroyed	That is so sad. You should get a second opinion from someone higher up."
"Yeah. I feel pretty bad about it.	Oh no! What book was it? I am so sorry to hear that."
"I found my dog's old toy. It brought back memories of when I first got her	Were those the good kind of memories"
"I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of dog was she?	A pit bull, I'm not too sure. Did you find out what breed?"
"After months of job searching, I finally got a good offer	That's great! Did you find a good place?"
"I got a job in statistics	Congratulations! Statistics are pretty fun!"
"I have a final exam that I've been studying for for days.	Good luck! Do you think you will do well on it?"
"I think I will do really well. I feel prepared for it.	That's good. Your hard work is paying off!"
"I stupidly lent my car to a friend.	Why did you lend it to a friend? You must feel bad about it!"
"He got drunk and took it for a joyride. It didn't end well.	Oh no! What did he end up doing with it?!"
"Even though I could've gotten more money at another job, I've stayed with my current employer. It is a good place to work.	It sounds like you've got a great job lined up for when you're retireable. I'm sure your family and friends are excited for you."
"I work in public relations. I create campaigns for companies.	Those are great jobs to have."
"I recently did a very successful one for a medical company.	I'm no public relations major, but I've done a few things for companies."
"I just had a job interview that went really well. I'm expecting a call pretty soon.	How do you feel about the call?"
"It's a statistical analyst job.	What is the job for? That must be pretty exciting!"
"I recently moved to a new city. I left behind some good friends.	Friends are so useful in new places, it can be hard sometimes leaving behind so many people. How is your new place?"
"That's very true. It'll just take some time.	That is true.. It takes time.. But good friends are always there to support you."
"Last week I was at the grocery store picking up body wash. There were so many to chose from, but I couldn't help but buy my trusted brand that has served me well for so many years.	I feel your pain. I have so much to choose from right now as well. What brand do you like?"
"Yes, why try something new when what you have been using has worked so well.	Exactly! I usually go for new if there is a good alternative. I hate paying extra for something I've used before! I do it all the time. I always end up getting the good stuff!"
"I have to show some brand loyalty!	I have so much to do today, but it's raining. I'm OK with just staying at home and doing nothing.	Same here. I love just sitting at home and watching tv. No need to rush anything!"
"It sucks. Maybe it'll be dry this weekend.	Staying inside a bit won't do much anyway."
"My dog I had for five years just passed away. He was hit by a car last night.	I'm so sorry. I know it's probably for the best but it's hard when they're so close."
"It is just so sad to have my loyal companion taken away like that.	That's awful, I'm very sorry to hear about your loyal companion... Have you thought about getting another dog?"
"His name was Han Solo, I am a huge Star Wars fan. My wife thought it was a dorky name, but I loved it.	I'm ready for hurricane season. I have my kit ready and everything.	Are you going to be ready for a tropical storm?"
"South Alabama, near the Gulf.	Sounds like fun! Are you a diver?"
"I have been sick the last week and my wife has made my chicken broth soup every day!	That's really nice of her!"
"She is such a blessing to me and spoils me so much.	She sounds so wonderful and caring! I'm so glad that you have such a great wife."
"Yeah, I try to treat her the best I can, can't lose someone that amazing.	When I go out to a restaurant, I order gluten free food items.  I have to trust that the cook and server take my request seriously.  If not, my food could be ""gluten free"" but cross contaminated with foods that aren't and still make me ill.	Oh wow that sounds serious. Has this happened in the past with you as well?"
"If it's mild, just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say, eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten, my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!	That's so gross! I would just be sad that it was an accident."
"Inflammation is the devil.  I'm just glad I found out how to manage it to improve my quality of life.	We ordered 3 diet cokes with dinner the other night, and they all came out a different shade of coloring!	Those cokers always seem to mess me up!  What were you going to get instead?  I've always wanted some diet dr. Pepper lol.  What were you trying to get?  Some diet dr. Pepper?  And were they bad?  I've never tried diet dr. Pepper, so if"
"I was concerned they were the wrong drink order, we lined them up and talked to the server and together figured out the syrup bag must be going empty!	That is hilarious and frustrating.  I hope they got you."
"While cleaning out our closets, I always find some old item that reminds me how little the girls used to be.  Last time it was a cute pair of jeans in toddler sizing we saved to make ""jean purses"" out of someday.  My kid is 14 this week!!!	Wow, 14?!  That's amazing!  It's hard to imagine life without the kids these days!"
"It definitely triggers some emotions!  Then I'm torn between keeping it a little longer or finally purging.	Awww, yeah kids can be a handful! Hopefully they don't grow up to be jeans or something lol"
"My wife made me pancakes for breakfast. I have a full belly and feel rather happy now.	Dang! That's a good morning snack! What kind of pancakes did she make?"
"One of my favorite breakfast foods. She also made some thick sliced bacon. She treats me so well.	pancake holes are a favorite of mine. I love bacon, too! What kind of pancakes were they?"
"For sure, no other woman I would rather have.	That's really nice! You are a lucky lady!"
"How can I complain when she gets up early to make me such a great meal!	Exactly! I would never cheat my wife like that!"
"I told my brother that I was planning to propose to my best friend, but I hope he keeps it a secret!	Oh my goodness! Why do you think he won't?"
"He lets things slip once in a while, but this is a pretty big secret so I have confidence in him.	That is a really big secret to keep.  I hope he says the big surprise when the time is right!"
"I have a friend who is struggling right now in her business.  I'm trying hard to be there to support and cheer her on.	That is so nice of you. Being a great friend should help her in any difficult situation."
"RIght? Even if I can't directly affect her business, I can help keep her spirits up to weather the storm!	Thats great that you are trying your best to help."
"I saw my neighbor bought the car I have always wanted. I wish I was in a a better financial position to buy one.	I am happy that you were there to help your neighbor! What type of car is it?"
"Subaru Brat, best car ever made. Its like a car and a t ruck all in one.	I would love to have that"
"I know, it would look perfect in front of my double wide mobile home! There is a used one on the corner for $350. But that will take me months to save up.	I have an subaru brat myself! Such a great car!"
"Yeah, or I could buy more scratch offs at the gas station and hit it big.	I have never won a scratch off!"
"I am in the process of potty training my daughter, but when we go somewhere she still wears a diaper. The other day, we were at church and she took her diaper off in the middle of the service.	Oh no. I guess she didn't have a very good childhood? It is pretty bad when a kid wears diaper all day."
"It was not one of our best moments. Luckily, she was wearing and long dress and I had extra diapers so we could remedy the situation.	That is unfortunate. It happens."
"I ordered a new toy for my son online for his birthday.	What toy did he want? A football or something else?"
"No, not yet. But, I can't wait to! He's going to have so much fun with it.	what toy is it"
"My husband and I are going on our very first cruise in December. i can't wait!!!	That's awesome. I've never cruised on my own! Where are you going??"
"I hope so too. I have wanted to go on a cruise for so long. I'm happy were are able to go this year.	That sounds amazing!  Where are you going!"
"We are going with a few friends, so they booked it and we got a discount because they are returning customers.	My dad called me one day crying out for help. I had to drive over to his house.	Oh man. Was it a long drive. Im not super far from you"
"He had fallen and bruised his ribs. I had to take him to the hospital.	That's terrible! I hope he's alright."
"Even though I'm a christian and I serve God to the best of my abilities, I have been in a rut lately. Last week, during revival, for the first few nights, everyone was praising and participating in worship and just really feeling the Spirit, but I couldn't for whatever reason, and it made me feel bad.	Maybe they have changed some since you last visited."
"Yes, I prayed about it multiple times, and by the last night, I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too. It felt amazing and it carried over into both services on Sunday too.	That's good. I am happy it has worked out that way for you! I know you wouldn't want to do anything differently"
"Thank you. He is all knowing and I'm just so thankful that he cares about me.	Sometimes I wake up at night and eat junk food.	Why junk food?"
"Yeah but I feel bad afterwards. I like to make peanut butter and nutella sandwiches with chocolate chip cookies.	I do that too! Sometimes I'll do jello or spaghetti with meat sauce, too. Don't beat yourself up about it though! You're doing God's work"
"We had a birthday party for my son the other day!	Nice!  Did you guys have a good time and get a good laugh at the same time"
"He's 6. It was so much fun to watch him open his presents.	That is so sweet.  I bet he loved every minute!"
"I was the captain of the volley ball team in middle school and high school, so I signed my daughters up to play. since they had an interest in it too. When we got the practice on the first day, the coach said that it was her first year coaching and she asked me if I would help a little.	That's awesome! I bet she was proud too."
"I was very excite to help. I miss playing very much, so being able to play with my daughters and show of my skills a little was great.	That's wonderful! I was never the athletic type but my mom was an awesome volleyball coach!"
"A couple years ago, I was hospitalized and diagnosed with MS.	That is terrible! Did it turn out ok?"
"Yeah, I was blind in my right eye, and my left arm was numb.	that is terrible, i'm so sorry to hear about this, is it possible to have your arm completely limb free, or is it still very painful?"
"My friend has been sick a lot recently and I am worried about her.	That's terrible. I hope she feels better soon!"
"Yes.  She has been vomiting and having diarhea a lot	That's not good. What is her doctor saying? That it could be something serious."
"Yes.  It has just happened on and off for months.	I am sitting here chilling out with my cat on my lap.	That sounds so relaxing!  What's his name?"
"Yes.  My cat is relaxing and always sleeping	That sounds like you got some pretty great cats!"
"I had a job interview last week	How did it go"
"I am not sure yet.  I was very nervous	Those job previews give you so much hope and excitement and uncertainty. You will know on Monday."
"Next week I think	I spent a weekend at a lake house all by myself.	did you like it?"
"It was fantastic.  I found it so restful and peaceful just to get away from it all for a while.	sounds nice"
"I had a get together recently, One of my friends brought someone who couldn't hold their liquor.	lol....that is funny. Did they get busted?"
"Heh, well they projectile vomited all over my carpet, it was gross.	I bet you wanted to vomit!"
"Me and my daughter went to the skate park the other day.	Did you enjoy it?"
"Yeah we did. She can ride up and down the ramps much better than I expected her to.	Thats awesome. I wish i could afford to go skate park."
"I've been out of work, and my dads been helping me financially.	Well, that sounds like he's a good dad!"
"No, I am filing for disability. Theres no way I can ever repay him	disability is the worst!"
"I had to meet my new physical therapist this week.	What did you have to meet him for? Was it a good thing or a problem?"
"They seem ok. I just hate having to meet new doctors.	Psychiatrist here. Have you had trouble meeting with them?"
"This is the first time ever that both of my kids have been in school.	Oh really? That must have made you a bit anxious? Were you able to relax during this time?"
"Yeah, it's just too quiet lol.	Aw, that's cute! Mine started a few weeks ago. I'm sure it will get a bit busier soon."
"Recently my family had a trip that was very disorganized. Basically drove a long way to hang see my family for a handful of hours.	Did you enjoy the visit?"
"Same. I wish I had just stayed at home instead of spending all that time on the road.	That is the worst. I hate when that happens. Did they reschedule the trip?"
"That is true, I guess there is that to be thankful for.	I had to wait in line at the store the other day for 15 minutes!	that must've been aggravating"
"Just some random food stuffs. It wouldn't have been so bad but there was only one cashier.	That is so annoying! How was the service?"
"I had to go to my brother in laws funeral last week.	Oh, that's too bad. I am sure that was tough.  Were you close to him?"
"I'm ok. It just hit me hard seeing all those sad people.	It hit you pretty hard I bet, I am so sorry for your loss"
"I have some friends who are traveling all over Europe this summer	Cool, where did they go?"
"I am!  I would love to go myself.	wow that's cool, i bet it will be an awesome trip for you. where are they flying to?"
"My and some old friends from college recently got together. It's always great to see those guys again.	college? why is it better this time?"
"Same. And all these guys live in different places now so it's harder and harder to get everyone together.	That's cool. I haven't seen most of my friends in person in years."
"No. We've had a group text going for several years so we just all decided it had been too long.	That sucks.. group text is the best way to find people"
"My wife bought some new clothes and in classic fashion she lied about how much she actually spent.	That was really nice though"
"I know I know. I just wish she could tell me up front. I get more irritated finding out she lied about it.	That is really irritating. Did she apologize at all to you or let you make up your own story?"
"Oh, I've tried...	This weekend I saw one woman being kind of mean to another woman of color.	Oh no! What happened afterwards?"
"No kidding! I don't see how those kind of people are still around. No. It had already escalated by the time I saw it. We figured it was best to just keep moving.	That is terrible. Did they get in fights?"
"No. She just thought the other woman wasnt doing her job. Classic sense of entitlement.	I'm sorry you had to witness that."
"I dont get to see my only niece too often. I was supposed to babysit her recently, but it fell through. I was kinda sad I didnt get to see her.	Oh no. I'm so sorry. That's one of my biggest pet peeves too. No niece but I'm so tired of paying bills. Kids just ruin life for everyone."
"We just dont live super close so it always makes it harder.	Oh no, that is hard! I'm really sorry to hear that. Maybe next time?"
"The last few weeks have been spent buys school clothes, shoes, and supplies so my girls would be ready to go back to school. There first day was yesterday and it went well.	Nice, school starts today for my little girl!"
"I'm home with my toddler, so I drop them off and pick them up. The school is exactly 7 minutes away. I'm glad my shopping in advance paid off.	What an amazing feeling! Isn't it nice to not have to wait until school to go?"
"Recently had some test run at the doctors office and it took a few weeks to get the results back.	how did it turn out"
"Yes fortunately everything turned out ok. But it was nerve wracking waiting on the answer.	I bet you were anxious. Did everything turn out ok?"
"My husband's grandfather recently passed away, and his three sons are acting very childish and selfish about everything concerning the will.	I'm so sorry for your loss, but remember he has always loved you and will always love you unconditionally"
"It really is. The worst part is that they had arguments in front of him, while he was sick, about who should get what. I wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him. That's what my husband and I tried to do.	That is so sad to hear! It is hard to be in those situations and seeing the other side of it."
"Yes, the whole situation made me mad then and mad now. There is nothing I can do though except pray about it.	Watching my daughters play volley ball with their team makes me remember all the games I played in with my friends.	What kind of games?"
"The memories are awesome and I miss playing.But I wouldn't trade the life I live now to go back,	That must make you feel very nostalgic."
"I am going fishing at my favorite spot tomorrow. I know I am going to catch something!	That's awesome! I'm sure you'll catch something cool! What are you fishing for?"
"Blue catfish, they get so huge. I have a secret recipe for stink bait that works well!	That's really neat! What are you going to get?"
"Oh I will, fried catfish is so amazing. Especially beer battered!	I am going to play dominos tonight	What are you playing?"
"Well with some locals at the local brewpub	Sounds like a fun time! What are you most excited for?"
"Yes I think I will do well even though I just learned last week how to play!	my family came to visit recently, i always get so nervous about people visiting.	why were they coming?"
"I have to make sure the house is clean and that everything is in order before they arrive, nerve wracking!	I imagine, but I'm glad they're visiting!"
"I have a birthday coming up. I really hop I get the gift I am asking for.	What gift are you asking for?  What makes you so excited?"
"Thank you, I am hoping for a new camera. It is about time to upgrade.	What gift are you asking for?"
"Thanks, I really enjoy getting out and photographing nature.	My dog go into the trash can and drug it all over the house. I am so mad right now!	That is terrible. What did you do to stop it?"
"I know, it is going to take me all evening to clean up!	That's disgusting! Have you tried talking to your neighbor about what is happening?"
"He is usually good, but this time his naughtiness got to him.	I am going camping this weekend. I got my tent, sleeping bag and tons of food. I think I have everything I need!	That sounds like a lot of fun! I am actually jealous of you. You sound very prepared."
"Oh I will, I am ready for whatever the elements throw at me!	Where do you live? I live in the south."
"It will be a blast, I just love roughing it in the outdoors!	The other night i heard a sound like someone was breaking in my house, i was pretty scared.	Oh my goodness that sounds terrifying. Did you find out what it was?"
"No, it turns out the power had went out for a minute and it was the sound of the printer calibrating.	That's so awesome. I love waking up in the middle of the night to hear strange sounds like break in or fire or police or what have you. I live alone though."
"It has been raining a lot lately, I am really trusting the seal on our doors to keep the water out.	Has it rained that often in the past? I remember the same thing happening when I was a student in Athena. Did they get it repaired?"
"I know, it really starts too pool up by our house. It is getting kind of scary!	oh no. Keep doors boarded up and someone will watch them out!"
"Yeah, really don't want to deal with a flooded home! Would not be good for my family.	I bought a cake from the store and it ended up tasting terrible.	That's disappointing. What flavor was it?"
"No, I ended up just suffering through it and eating it.	Haha, that's funny! Yeah, it's no wonder some things taste terrible! I'm sorry that you were let down!"
"Yeah, I am afraid to return things. The clerks kind of scare me.	I was nervous about an upcoming job interview recently, I bought a new outfit and got a haircut to make myself feel better.	I hope it went well! Did the job come with a better job, or did you find another one?"
"Yea, it made me feel better about myself and my chances, or maybe i just like spending money	Yea I think you're onto something there."
"I love chocolate cookies because my grams would always make them for me.	Me too! They are the best aren't they?  What's your sweet tooth?"
"Nothing beats cookies made by grandma. Except for the oatmeal ones. Too healthy haha.	Oh yea, I love those too! But I'm more of a creamsicle man myself."
"Only if it has raisins to sweeten them up!	I found an old picture of when my oldest daughter started kindergarten 11 years ago.	Do you remember the first day or the year she was born?  Did you cry?"
"It is!  In it, she's just standing with a huge smile on her face and a Hello Kitty backpack.	That's so sweet!"
"I've been teaching my young daughter to play video games with me, she's such a quick learner.	It's great that you're teaching her the ropes!"
"Minecraft and asphalt racing are two of them, It's amazing to watch a child learn and grow their intelligence.	That is so cool. It sounds like you are a great parent."
"It broke my heart today when I went to the grocery store and found out that they were out of Dean's French Onion Dip.	Oh man. I have no idea what that is"
"I do!  I've loved that particular brand for years - to me it's the best out there.  But I guess there's quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!	I can understand that. Dean's French Onion Dip is one I've never had, and I'm not even close."
"Oniony gold!  That's a very apt description!	I'm glad I stuck my job out as long as I did - I finally got offered a promotion today.	Congradulations.  I am also looking for an upgrade.  Is it a raise?"
"It is!  I'll actually be the manager of the entire office, and not just the one section I was in!	Congratulations! That sounds like you've done a great job. Is this something that your company are anticipating?"
"I try to.  But I'm glad all the effort is being recognized!	I put in to get a promotion at work, and I should know something either way by tomorrow.	Is it a pay bump?"
"On the one hand, I am but on the other hand I have to relax knowing I did everything I could do and worked as hard as I could.  It's kinda out of my hands now.	Well I wish both ways. I bet you did everything you could and probably got the promotion."
"I work for a medical supply company.	That's a tough position to be in, but I'm happy you're making some money, and hopefully that gives you some relief from stress!"
"Last week, they arrested 9 people for animal cruelty at a nearby farm and the place was littered with dead and sick and dying animals that they weren't taking care of.	Why did you feel they needed to take care of that?  Did they get off with some fines?"
"I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man, but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!	That sounds horrible.  I would feel so awful if I were in charge of any jail.  Do they have to take the punishment themselves?"
"Where I live, they're only now starting to toughen up the animal cruelty laws.  Even so, they lag far behind a lot of other states.	When the England national team made the semi-finals of the World Cup	Wow, I can remember my dad watching that. Was he very proud?"
"So good, genuinely had my faith restored in the national team and everyone was having a good time larking about in good weather!	That must have thrilled you when it happened!"
"But yeah - school started for the kids today and it was weird how quiet it was once the bus pulled away.	Oh I know that feeling.  Were you on a schedule or were you home schooled?"
"It can.  But we had fun!  Visited lots of relatives, cooked lots of stuff, goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand, I miss having my kids around to do stuff with.	kids are fun but i do miss my 9 month old also being around all the time!"
"Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!	That is definitely the way to look at it!  It will be nice when they are all grown up and no more worries of theirs."
"I had to clean beneath a desk which had not been cleaned in about three years, after there had been some flooding from a manufacturing unit. It was so gross!	I would have been so annoyed!"
"Yes indeed, there was even a frog under there! So bizarre!	That's so gross! I would freak out if something had a stench or rottenous stench!"
"They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!	What a bunch of cowokers."
"Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.	What type of farm do you live on?"
"Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully, those animals can find good care and good homes.	I know. I feel like I'm one of the luckiest people ever when I rescue an animal!  Sometimes I have to rescue the most horrible things...but it's good when I get to help others too."
"And in my opinion, the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough - they should have had to stay in jail!	Yeah it is really ridiculous the amount of people that get into animal shelters and abuse them, and I agree the bond should have been much higher."
"My son's soccer coach said nice things about his play last year and told me he would do what he could to get him on his team this year as well.	That's cool. I hope he's right."
"I am, too!  I'm glad he's doing something he loves.  At this point, I'm just waiting on the text to see which team he made it onto.	What a nice and motivating kid coach!"
"I'm so glad the kids went back to school today!	Me too. We went to get some laundry and now it's just us. Hbu"
"Yes!  I can go back to having ice cream for breakfast!  I can watch Law and Order all I want to without the, ""Mom, you always watch this!"" comment!	Lol.  Kids go back to school???  That's a first for me!"
"How old are they?	50 and 59.  Both mustaches!"
"Enjoy them now!  Mine are 17, 15, and 10 and too cool for *everything*.  LOL	My two best friends are going on vacation next week and I won't have anyone else at work to goof off with.	Aww, are they coming back to visit you?"
"On the one hand, I hope so but on the other hand, I'll get bored because there's nothing to break up the day.  Just straight...ugh!  XD	Haha! I feel the same way! It can get pretty monotone if you're all alone.  What are you planning on doing?"
"I went for a walk the other day and one of the neighbors dogs was loose, a bit white husky, he was aggressive.	Were you able to get him inside."
"He was growling at me and looked like he wanted to bite me, the neighbor finally came out and called him home. was intense.	That must have been very scary.  Glad you got him back."
"The little kitten I rescued last Friday passed away.	I'm sorry to hear this. Are you ok taking care of the little guy/her?"
"She was under my house, crying.  Her mother had apparently abandoned her.  I called my friend who said she was dehydrated and we did what we could, but her motor functions quit and she passed away in her sleep.	That is terrible, I hope everything went okay"
"And that kitten knew she was loved.  It ended sad, but I take comfort in those things.	My 6 year old tried to play a video game but couldn't understand how the controller worked. A few days later she was playing no problem!	That is awesome, kids are so awesome!"
"Yea, i was pretty proud of her, especially since things are more complicated now than when i was a kid.	Sounds like she might be one of the luckiest girls on this earth."
"I thought I had paid all my daughter's band fees only to find out that I'm 10 dollars short.	oh no, that is horrible. what did you do?"
"I keep all my receipts - I learned that lesson her 9th grade year.  I just hate having to make the trip over to the high school because it's in the opposite direction of where I do everything else!	Oh man, that is a tough situation to be in. Did she speak to her teacher, or did they just tell her that band fees went to your tuition?"
"I went through a divorce last year, which caught me off guard financially, luckily my mom was able to help with some of the costs.	I am so sorry to hear about that. Were you able to get the money back?"
"Yea i'm much better now, thanks to my mom. Attorneys make a killing on these types of things.	That is good, divorce can be very expensive."
"When my wife left me it was so quiet in the house! it almost drove me crazy	I am so sorry to hear that, I am glad you escaped it."
"hah, i hear ya. I just got so used to all the commotion i suppose.	That happened with my wife, it is crazy the amount of people on both ends!"
"When we were kids, my sister and i once stole a blank check from our mom to order a pizza, we got caught.	Did it bring shame on your family?"
"My mom noticed the charge and found a the missing check from her checkbook, i'll never forget the look of dissapointment on her face!	Wow. Did she laugh about that with you?"
"Oh yea. grounded for a long time.	I just saw a movie I had been looking forward to and it was terrible	What movie?"
"It was the new Jurassic World	Oh no! Did it ruin your plans?  Did it make you upset?  What was the movie about?"
"My coworker forgot to turn in the paperwork to switch our on call weeks. He ended up costing me $250! I'm so mad!!!	That's a stupid reason to cut your ties."
"He's such a worm. I can't stand it.	That's terrible!  I hope you had someone come in and fix that problem for you!  That's so messed up"
"Working from home can be difficult when people won't leave me alone to get work done.	I can understand that. It can be difficult to find someone to work from home."
"I love my kid but she is non stop with trying to show me the latest my little pony video, gonna pull my hair out.	Hahaha that's funny! I feel you. At least with my son he doesn't have the energy to drive me anywhere!"
"I have a big date coming up and I can't get these butterfly feelings to go away.	Those butterflies are always good. What are you going to be looking for in the air?"
"Yeah, I really think she might be the one. I hope I don't screw it up.	Where is the date? Is she taking you out or taking a trip out with your friends and family?"
"Thank you, I am looking forward to taking her to a nice place to eat!	I bit into an apple and found a worm. It was so gross.	ewww.ye same thing. did you give it back"
"Yeah, but not what I want to bite into when I am trying to enjoy my apple.	Oh that is so gross! Did you try eating it without the worm in it?"
"That is true, I should be thankful for that.	I was hiking in the mountains and walked up on a female bear with her two cubs.	Wow! Did you try to scare her away? Sheesh what a size difference."
"They really startled me, the female did not seem happy to see me.	Oh wow! Did you try to scare it away?"
"Yeah, thankfully I was able to get away. It took a while for me to catch my breath.	I got a new dog recently, he is the best. I am so thankful for him!	What type? Is he a mutt of some sort?"
"He is a male australian shepherd. His name is charlie, he is super cute!	Thats an awesome name charlie!"
"Will do! He is super cuddly and loves to follow me around!	There was one piece of pie left in the fridge. Instead of sharing it, I ate it. I kind of feel bad.	It's alright, pie is good"
"It might not be when my wife returns and sees it gone. I look super guilty right now.	Eww. Maybe you shouldn't do that again."
"I could, I might have to buy her some of her favorite chocolate.	I was at the park today and almost stepped on a rattle snake. I almost jumped out of my skin.	I would have totally jumped out of my skin! I hate snakes so much, especially ones with sharp be heads! Did you get hurt doing it, at least?"
"Me too, that would of wrecked my day. It was so close! It haunts my thoughts even now.	I hate snakes soooo much! Did it hurt you?"
"It might take me a little while to get over my fear and go back to the park.	That is crazy! I hope you are ok."
"For sure, wouldn't want to relive that experience	I just got a bonus from my job. That money came at the perfect time!	How much did you get"
"It was a really nice bonus too, they were impressed with the quality of work I have done this year.	Nice! I hope they gave it to you in the form of a check?"
"Now I will have to work even harder and try to earn a larger one next year.	I was going to go to the movies with a bunch of friends. But they all bailed on me and now I have to go alone.	That really sucks! Did they have a good reason? Were you really alone?"
"I hope so, but I am really missing them right now. I didn't want to go alone.	That's too bad, are you going to see someone new?"
"It is hard to find reliable friends. No one seems to show up anymore.	I was out photographing butterflies and took the most incredible photo. I am really happy with how it turned out!	I would love to try and grow an overwatch plant! How big was the plant?"
"The butterfly was yellow. It was a tiger swallowtail. One of my favorites!	I love butterflies! What kind of photo were you using for it?"
"I saw my dog try to eat a dirty diaper one time	how gross! did you say something?"
"Yeah, it's nasty. I wouldn't let her lick my face for a while after that.	Hahaha that's so disgusting! Did your dog get the memo that no matter what she does you have to keep her from trying that?"
"I was trying to take a nap, but my cat kept on trying to play with my head.	did he get tired or did he keep bothering you?"
"I usually love mine, but not when it is keeping me from sleeping	My cat does that too, he is so mean!"
"I just had a job interview and I'm waiting to hear if I got the job.	Oh nice! I bet you are excited!"
"Me too. I'm feeling pretty nervous about it	Good luck! I'm sure that if you just keep being yourself you'll do great!"
"I was on a plane ride and we went through some pretty severe turbulence	Oh my, I bet that must have worried you!  Was it an easy landing?"
"Yes it was. I was so afraid we'd crash	That must have been very turbulence y"
"My cousin and I tricked my butler into thinking he won millions in the lottery. I feel so bad.	Oh wow! What a devious scheme! What are going to do to repay this debt>"
"Only a few minutes.	Oh my gosh! Why didn't he take you on the trip?"
"Someone came to my door with a gun, asking for money	Oh no, that's awful! Did you get in and say anything?"
"I didn't have any. He came into the house and stole some stuff	What stuff were they stealing?"
"Our cat had to many health problems, so we had to put him down.	oh sorry about your cat, how old was your cat?"
"I had him for 17 years, he lived a full and happy life, but I was not ready for him to go.	That's so sad. I can imagine it must have left a very big impression on you as a pet owner"
"But they make your life so much enjoyable while they are around!	I went to do karaoke with a guy i'm dating and I discovered he's a really talented singer	Really? How did that make you think so?"
"He's kind of shy about it. He had to get really drunk to perform karaoke	That's cool, are you going to see him in concert?"
"I had to do a research project and present it to my professors to graduate. Thankfully I passed!	What was the project on?"
"I worked many long hours. It was stressful but I'm happy to have done well	Congratulations! That's great. Sometimes hard work can pay off!"
"My sister has been playing a song I dislike over and over and over	Why is the song so bad?"
"She does it more because she likes it than to bug me. It's going to be stuck in my head for weeks	what is the song? i'd love to know"
"okay.	What did you say?"
"That is great! What will you be doing there?	im going back to my original passion of writing."
"I accidentally slapped someone in the face while I was playing basketball.	Oh my gosh. Why did you do that?"
"No, I think she was just a little shocked by it. I felt so bad.	Oh no! I hope she didn't get hurt"
"I let my friend borrow my car. He's an international student and only has a permit.	What did he do with the borrowed car?"
"I was in the car with him. He just wanted to practice driving and he didn't have his own car.	That is very nice of him."
"I am at a cross road. I am trying to decide my major in college.	Are you worried?"
"I was thinking about graphic design. Or, I was going to do something practical like Nursing.	Nurse! That's sounds like an amazing passion! Are you already in school?"
"I guess you are right. I really like sketching and painting. I can use my creativity side.	I've been trying to save money so that I can help my husband with the Christmas shopping this year.	Have you been trying this entire time?"
"Well at first I was a little discouraged because I wasn't making that much. Things have picked up recently though, and I feel I will be able to help him a good bit so I'm feeling better about it.	That's great. I think it is important for couples to work towards a better financial future."
"I had planned to take my daughter shopping a few weeks ago. We were all really excited, but the plans fell through.	Oh no! What a bummer!"
"Yes. We were able to go about a week later, but the closer it got to school starting back I started to stress. Everything is good now though.	I hate when that happens!"
"I check in with my partner to see if we are okay. I ask him if there is anything that we can work on to make the relationship better.	Is he usually okay with that?"
"I don't want to have problems. This is why I check in with him.	Making the relationship better is important. Having an open relationship is great."
"When I go out with friends I really have to be tight with my money. Times are really hard for me financially?	I'm so understand.  You have to make a budget and budget for everything."
"I like go out but I have to really make sure that I don't spend too much. I sometimes like to leave a tip if possible.	That's really sweet of you! What do you guys do for money?"
"I find it appalling how my husband's family is acting now that his grandfather has passed away.	I'm sorry to hear about that. It must be very upsetting for you and your family."
"Yes, it is. They are all being really selfish and childish. My husband is staying out of it, but I can tell that he is getting fed up with it.	That's hard, to hear about.. how long has he been gone?"
"I have to run several errands for my father-in-law today and he wants them done before my mother-in-law get into town, which is at some unspecified time today.	Is that an issue for him?"
"Yeah, I'm ready to get everything done so I can relax. I can't start on the errands until I drop the kids at school though.	That's smart, school starts next week for both my parents, I think school runs longer for them than most parents"
"I really do miss my mother. She has been dead for about 15 years now.	That sucks so much! I bet you are really sad."
"It is a blessing and curse. When I am having problems I think about what she would say to me.	15 years is such a long time! What kind of problems do you have?"
"Yes, it is. I know that time heals.	It does, and it does. But, in this day and age, it's hard to imagine someone not caring what you think."
"My children are getting old. They are starting to spread the wings. So, I would have to let go and let them fly.	That is a difficult position to take. It is an opinion shared by alot of people."
"I have 23, 20, 17 and 14. They are doing stuff that I question but I don't want them to not tell me stuff.	Do they have any real talents to show you?  I'm always curious to see what kind of gifts they would want from you.  It would be interesting to see what kind of gifts they'd want to receive in return."
"When I was in labor with my third child, they were monitoring me regularly in the hospital. The nurse came in and made a face and then called the doctor. In the 2 minutes it took for him to get to my room, my heart dropped and I started to panic. He told me that the baby's heart rate had dropped and they had to preform an emergency C-section right then.	Oh my god. I can imagine that would be scary! I can just picture you crumpling up and giving that look."
"Yes, everything turned out fine. She is a healthy and happy three year old. It was the scariest day of my life though.	What a nightmare! I am so glad that all went well for you!"
"Yes, they do. I ope your boy is all good now.	I finally beat level 150 on the crucible today in my favorite game Grim Dawn.	Wow, that is really good. I am sure you are a great person."
"PC all the way. I've been grinding devotion points all week.	Congratulation! That is awesome.  I have never been able to do that for any video game.  Only singleplayer ones.  What is your favorite video game?"
"I just found a hello kitty pot in my daughters room filled with water and old flowers.	Oh that's sweet.  How is she doing today?"
"It's not cute, and she's nine. By old flowers I mean, it's a green, stagnant slush with mold growing on top.	oh no! that sounds so gross!"
"When I enter the bus, I fainted. I think that I got overheated.	Wow. That's a pretty bad incident to fume upon...well unless you're a lunatic."
"Yes I did. It was so hot outside and I did not have much to drink.	oh no that sounds terrible. I'm glad you're ok now though. did anyone see you fainted? did it look like you might be sick for days?"
"I got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of my friends	I'm so sorry! Did you not mean to do it?"
"I fell down, and apparently said some embarrassing things.	oh no did any of them see what happened"
"My daughter is graduating from college. I cannot wait until she finish.	That is great. Is this your first year?"
"Yes, I will. She has been under a lot of stress.	That is great. I finished school 5 years ago. Its a good feeling to be done."
"Two years ago I got diagnosed with MS.	I'm sorry to hear that. Did it get better?"
"Its a disease that attacks the nervous system. It was really scary to find out I had it. I just went blind in my right eye one day. Two days and several test later I found out I had MS.	It sounds terrible, i am so very sorry to hear about this."
"I found out that my daughter is moving out. My youngest one told me so.	Where is she moving too?"
"I feel really sad because I felt she should have told me.	Children, you are amazing. How old is she"
"I let my sister borrow my car. She is a new driver.	That's nice, how did it go?"
"Well, nothing. I'm sure that she will be a responsible driver.	That's cool, you guys got a good relationship going!"
"I think that I will do good on my test.	That's a good sign you should be careful what you decide to study."
"It is tonight. I studied really hard.	that is great, what is the class?"
"I heard a song that I hadn't heard in awhile. It reminded me of my high school days	Ah yes! What was the song?"
"Yes, it had me feeling nostalgic about the times when I was young.	What song is it?"
"My dad dies when I was 33 years old.	Oh wow. Im so sorry to hear that"
"Thank you. I was crushed, and it left me with questions about my own mortality.	Oh wow. I'm so sorry. Are you handling it ok?"
"My mother fell and injured herself. I wanted help and comfort her in any way possible.	That's terrible! I'm sorry that she's going through that tough time."
"Yes, but bhe bruised her wrist, and had a concussion. I wish that I was there for her when it happened.	That's really rough. I hope that it wasn't serious."
"I had a nice meal and my favorite beverage after work	Nice. What was it?"
"It was a skirt steak with avocados. I was very satisfied.	Nice! What kind of drink was it?  Did it have fruit in it, too?  That's what my friend calls it, ha ha.  I love fruit!  What about yours, if you don't mind me asking?"
"When I started a new job. I was nervous about proving myself all over again.	How do you like it now?"
"I did, but I find it hard to trust people. Especially at work.	I am sure you did great, what industry did you start?"
"I am trying to quit drinking soda and I have prayed to God and asked Him to help me. The problem is I am addicted to soda and Its very hard to quit. When I do manage to skip a day, the lack of caffeine causes horrible headaches.	Caffeine is the devil in coffee, I would take God with me on any journey to quit.  I've been told so many different types of people have had their issues and it is very addicting."
"It just makes me feel bad, that no matter how many times I try, I still give in to the temptation.	Try AA meetings or online forums. That helped me with my addiction.  Sometimes the members are really helpful and willing to listen"
"Yeah, I think that's what I will have to do. Thanks for the advice.	I went on a job interview. I'm anxiously waiting to hear if I got the job.	What kind of job?"
"I still need wait another week.	I hope it works out for you!"
"A drafter.	I just went to clean my kids sink a few minutes ago. I found a bunch of toys in the catch and I am mad.	Did they get in while they were cleaning?"
"Yeah, all the toys are out. But, they got some explaining to do after school.	That's infuriating. Maybe you should have them explain it to you in detail."
"I couldn't sleep last night. I ended up staying up till 2am and eating a large amount of Shepard's pie.	That is very nice of you.  What kind of pie was it?"
"Combination of stress and new meds I think. Maybe I can get back to my old scheduled soon.	That sounds awful. I hope you feel better as well as get some sleep. But yes sounds like a possibility!"
"I saw my crush talking to another guy.	That sounds so awkward and unwanted.  How did it turn out?"
"I was a little upset, but it wasn't my business. I let it go.	How do you think it would feel to have your crush talked to by someone you don't even like?"
"When I went to the store the other day, I seen a guy all tweaked out on drugs.	that was me back in july"
"No, but he seemed a little unpredictable, so I used the other door.	maybe he was on shrooms"
"Holding each of my children for the first time was amazing.	It must have been so special to do that as an adult, I can't imagine doing it as a child!"
"Yes!! I can't think of any thing else that produces feelings like that.	I can only think of my wife when my kids were babies. holding them in my arms and hearing my thunderous screaming."
"I forgot about my grandmother's birthday a couple years back. I felt so bad about it!	That sucks, hopefully no one was hurt. Did she wish me a Happy Birthday then?"
"Absolutely! I called her the next day and made sure to visit her. :)	What an lovely surprise.  I bet she was delighted to see you again."
"She did. :) It ended up being a good visit anyway!	I was digging around in some of my old stuff at my dads the other day, and I found all my old paintball gear.	Thats cool! I bet that was really exciting!"
"No, just me. But, I am going to go play this weekend at a place up the road. It's been years since I've played.	I bet you'll do great. What kinds of paintballs do you play?"
"I went skydiving last summer with my partner. It was so scary!	Wow! How'd it go"
"Absolutely! I've always been scared of heights, but I'm so glad I made myself.	Oh wow! I have never done that before either! I am happy for you! I am afraid of heights, but love to see the wonderment in the sky!"
"When I was a kid, I had a dog at my grandpa's. He gave it away because it wouldn't hunt.	What kind of dog did it turn out to be? Was it a hound?"
"I was very upset. I was only like nine at the time so I took it really hard.	Oh man. I feel bad for laughing at your pain."
"I tripped and fell in front of some people.	On no! Are you ok, are you ok, are your legs bruised or anything?"
"No, only my pride was injured.	Oh no! Did they laugh at you?"
"I recently dug up a necklace my grandmother gave me when I was young for a birthday. I hadn't seen it in years.	Cool. What kind was it"
"Yeah, she passed more than five years ago and I had forgotten all about it. It brought back so many memories though!	I bet that was a happy memory for you"
"I just won an award for best yard in the neighborhood!	Congratulations! What was the award for? Something that you've been working on for a long time?"
"I did, mowed it three times a week and watered it twice a day. All the hard work really paid off.	Congratulations! That sounds great!"
"It is, it really stands out from all the brown grass in my neighbors yards.	I get to go to the park today for a BBQ with friends, it should be so much fun!	I love bbq!"
"We often throw around a frisbee for a little bit, but we never get too intense with any sports.	thats great, i love playing baseball or basketball sometimes"
"Me too, there has been a lot of rain lately. It should be fun hanging out with old friends!	That's sounds like a blast, do you play any sports?"
"I snuck some candy out of my daughter's snack stash. I feel bad because I had been trying to diet.	snorting is a very bad idea."
"Otherwise it's been pretty good- I've managed to lose 12 pounds! Just wish I could let the sugar cravings go.	That's really impressive. How did she find out about this"
"My childhood friend gave me a watch for by birthday a few years ago, I lost it in a move recently. I'm pretty upset by it.	Did he know you were going to be sad about it?"
"I've actually checked and went through all the boxes too. Here's hoping it turns up one day though!	Aww, that's so sweet! I hope the same for you!"
"I let my daughter ride in the road by herself on her skateboard the other day.	Oh yeah? How'd she do?"
"She did great. She's pretty good about looking out for cars.	that is really nice, kids can be so amazing"
"It is so upsetting that my daughter was in a car accident. I am thankful that she was fine but we lost our car because of someone's bad judgment.	That is so scary. Are they okay now?"
"It was. They wanted to blame my daughter but it was their fault.	It's really frustrating when people blame others for other's misdortunes.  Are you ok?"
"I was feeling really down for a few weeks and my sister knew. She drove hours to come see me and make me feel better!	She is a wonderful person! I am glad that you had someone to help you. :)"
"Yeah it was really sweet of her and made me feel so much better!	That was nice of her. You guys are close."
"I was recently on a long international flight and we hit some really bad turbulence.	Oh that sounds very scary!  I've never been on a flight before, and I'm always worried about that!  What happened?"
"I didn't, but I was really nervous for a little while. My wife didn't handle it quite as well.	That's okay. As long as you were able to land safely, I'm fine with that."
"For sure. And it was a great trip.	I screwed up plans for a date night with my wife. We ended up having to cancel and she was really mad about it.	I hate when wife's are that way!  Wife's never get tired, right?!"
"We did and I made sure to not screw that one up!	Well that's good that you made up for it. Hopefully, she doesn't find it too bad..."
"Me too. Who knows what would have happened to me if I did it twice.	I was able to go back home to my parents for a few weeks recently. It was wonderful to relax in my childhood home.	I agree, it is always good to visit"
"They loved having me around again! Our ten year old dog wouldn't leave my side.	That's good! Dogs can get crazy when they feel stressed! I'm happy that you got to see your old dog again!"
"I've been thinking about buying some new, softer skateboard wheels.	Neat! What are you going to get instead?"
"No, they make rough pavement feel smoother. I think I'll just keep the ones I have for now though. Just have to deal with having a rough ride.	Maybe if you save up a bit you can get some good wheels for cheap!"
"I took my dog I've had for years over to meet one of my husband's sisters the other night.	That was thoughtful of you. Did he enjoy the visit?"
"It did not go well at all! She pooped all over the carpet and she never has accidents at home.	That is too bad.  Have they fixed the issue yet?"
"Yeah, I think it might've been too much on her at once. I was pretty embarrassed.	I had to take my daughter to the doctor the other day. She was very sick.	That's terrible, is she okay?"
"It was just the flu. I got her some medicine, brought her home, and made tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches.	That sounds sooo healthy."
"So my sister is getting married in a few weeks.	Do you like her being married, or are you excited for her?"
"Absolutely! The whole family is flying out, we can barely contain ourselves.	Are they having a big wedding?"
"So my friend adopted a new kitten very recently.	Oh, kittens are so cute!  I love kittens myself!  Did they cost you a lot to adopt, at least?"
"Oh, she is absolutely adorable! I'm so envious, I haven't been able to adopt one yet.	I have a rescue cat.  You should adopt one!! adopt an animal that is not abused."
"Bought a new car a few months back. Couple nights ago we had a big storm roll through. I thought for sure it was going to hail all over my new car.	That sounds scary! What did the car do when the storm hit it? Was it OK after all?"
"Nice! We have a garage, but my wife takes up what little room isnt filled with junk with her car. Mine wouldnt fit anyway unless I cleared it out.	Thats good you have a garage"
"I do programming work and I recently had a question I had to run by a co-worker. He is a programming wizard. He easily handled my issue and was using terms and methods I had never even heard of.	That is awesome!  I have never been good at any kind of programming"
"That is true. I usually can keep up, but this guy is on another level.	Must have taken a while to get the hang of things."
"I had a meeting with my bosses the other day to discuss finally getting a promotion.	That's awesome!  Did you get a big raise?"
"I've been working there for a couple years now. I'm feeling pretty good about my chances! Haven't heard back yet.	Well, I hope that it works out!"
"I feel so good about knowing I am going to win the race on Sunday. The race is for my favorite charity. When I win the race I get to give my winnings to my charity of choice.	That is a great deal. You must be very excited to do well."
"Yes, it is my local animal shelter. They will be there to cheer me on!	That's great!  What type of charities has this been?  So I can be prepared for when I have lost before."
"My wife has had a trip in mind ever since I've known her. She recently had a big birthday so I surprised her with the trip. We went and she loved it. It made me happy to see her so happy.	What did she end up with?"
"It was just a trip to the west coast. There was a handful of things she's always wanted to see/do. So we did all of them.	Sounds like fun! What did you guys decide to do while we were there?"
"Not yet. We try to take one big trip a year if possible. We just got back from that one, so we will start plotting out next year a little later I would imagine.	I live in Florida. When I go home once a year it is a grand occasion.	That sounds awesome, I live in Florida too! High humidity, hurricanes and all that!"
"I grew up in Alabama. It is not far from Florida but still I get so thrill when I can go back to see family and friends.	I can imagine. It's not far at all from where I live now either, so when I go back to my childhood home I love it as well!"
"My sons first day of school was the other day.	What did he start?"
"Very first. I was so nervous till he got off the bus.	What an awesome day! How old is he?"
"I have a test coming up that I've been studying for weeks for.	And how do you feel about it?"
"It's a Japanese language test for college. I feel pretty good about it though, been going over and over it every night.	That sounds like a lot of studying!"
"I had phone interview for a job. It went very well	How did it go?"
"Thank you. I wrote down a list of questions and key points beforehand.	That's good, interview nerves can really get to someone head."
"I saw an old movie. It reminded me of my younger days.	What movie? Was it an action movie?"
"Yes. It's almost like a time machine. Fond memories.	What was the movie?"
"I lost my job because my company didn't pay rent at our location.	I'm so sorry to hear it. That really is a tough one. Did they offer to cover the bills?"
"Not very well. It makes me so angry. So I go work out to relieve the stress.	I am sorry, that sounds awful! You could have offered to pay the bills yourself."
"Recently my wife left me home alone with the dog all weekend while she was gone on a girls trip.	Oh no! Did she say how it went?"
"I missed her while she was gone. We have a mixed breed rescue pup.	That is so sad. I hope you are doing alright."
"Our computer system at work is goofing up a lot, but the development team just keeps saying there's nothing wrong.	Is it a big deal?  What kind of problems?"
"Sometimes. It doesn't stop me from doing things, just slows me down and takes longer than it should to do the things I need to do.	That sounds so frustrating! I am sure there is something wrong."
"Me too!	Every time my kids go to grandma's they get to eat all kinds of candies, and get new toys.	That must be so exciting for them!"
"Yeah they do! Some times I wish I got to go visit grandma's like they do lol.	Aw that's so sweet, I love visiting my grandma. Does she live close to you?"
"I was really happy when my nephew was born, Sadly i was informed he had cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease.	I am sorry to hear that, but happy that he got a healthy baby, that is what is most important"
"He's doing about as well as he can be. Very healthy, but without some new discoveries he will likely have a shortened lifespan.	Oh, that's very sad. I'm happy for your loss though!"
"I bought some cheap stocks hoping that they would go up in price. They didn't.	That is a bummer.  What happened??"
"Not too much. I only put in what I could afford to lose.	That is unfortunate.  I have had that happen to me before."
"I came home yesterday and my dog had pooped all over the floor. He hasnt done that in ages.	That is terrible. I would hate to have to deal with that every time I have to clean my house!!"
"Thanks. I dont think so. He has seemed fine otherwise. I've watched him on our security cam today and he seems fine. He is a mutt from a local shelter.	Maybe he had a bath or took a nap on your property!"
"Yeah. I love that goofy animal.  Hope he's ok	I work for a software company. I have been trying to learn a new language for some stuff. I knocked out my first task like a champ.	That is great, did you have any help with the language? like tutor and stuff"
"Well I have the opportunity, but rarely have the time to really devote to it.	Congrats! I know that feeling at times where you have more time to spend working on something you really want."
"Yeah i get that. I work for a startup so things change pretty rapidly around here.	I landed an ollie on my skateboard for the first time in 14 years yesterday.	How many years did you have to learn?"
"Yeah it took a lot of practice.	Good work. Skating is pretty much my favorite exercise"
"Next week I am off work and going to the beach.	Oh, that sounds awesome! What beach?"
"No I am going with my wife and her family. But we all get along great so it should be fun.	That should be so much fun!  The beach is really popular where you are going.  Where are you going?"
"Amen. It is much needed. Ready for some sun and a drink with an umbrella.	That sounds lovely.  Where ya headed to?"
"Not too long ago, I took a trip on a plane. The airline lost my whole suitcase!	Oh no! Did you have a lot of stuff with you that was important?"
"The whole vacation! I was so upset! I didn't have anything to wear for the duration.	That's awful!  I am so sorry that you had to go through that!"
"We usually don't do anything big for birthdays but my wife got me an apple watch this year.	That was nice of her!"
"Yeah i really did not see it coming at all.	That is very sweet, I bet you were shocked when she got you an apple watch!"
"My boss and I went to lunch and had a personal conversation about some life issues.	Did it go over good?"
"We just went to a local taco place. It was a good conversation.	It sounds like it was.  Did it go well for you?"
"It was more about just some personal life stuff. Not too much really.	I came back from a trip recently, got called in the boss's office and was given a decent sized raise.	Thats great!  Did he notice?  I bet that made your week!"
"Absolutely. I certainly won't say no to that.	Nice! Did he notice or did you not get a raise?"
"Budget is kind of tight lately and I am really afraid my wife's aging car is about to bite the dust.	What car is she talking about?"
"I may have to if that happens. We are making it now, but if the car goes it will be pretty tough.	Dang, hopefully the budget tightness isn't gonna keep you from spending more?"
"It is ok. We are probably too proud to take help anyway. We will make it.	It will be a tough situation. But you must do it! You got this."
"So I recently went through some old boxes and found some of my childhood dolls. It brought back a lot of memories!	That is always a nice thing when you get a chance to remember a past!"
"Absolutely! I remember having so much fun with them dressing them up. My sister and I would play for hours.	I love dressing up with my kids! It is so fun!"
"So, i may be in the market for a new laptop or a repair at least, thanks to a little mishap.	What happened?"
"My daughter tripped on the cord and it smashed on the ground, not sure if it can be saved. I was pretty angry.	That would really upset me too. How are you trying to clean the cord?"
"I woke up the other morning, got ready and drove all the way to work. Just to find out it was a holiday and we had the day off.	Did you have plans for the day after?"
"I know, but the extra day of work was nice. Especially since I wasn't expecting it.	Driving always feels extra special on a Sunday, no matter what."
"It was wonderful. I ended up being twice as productive since I got up early.	I know the feeling. It is wonderful to wake up early to extra work. I hope that it continues. :)"
"My new job is starting tomorrow. I'm feeling nervous, but really optimistic about it.	Congratulations.  What will you be doing?"
"It's a job they opened up for graphic design! I'm super excited to get started and learn more from them.	It is always a good sign when you have a fresh new experience. It will drive you hard"
"Going to my son's first pee-wee football game tomorrow!	That sounds like fun! Is he a big kid?"
"He thinks he does.  All I can think of is a bunch of Tiny Titans in helmets running around like chicks in a barnyard.  *chuckle*	You are going to have some nostalgia tears, my friend. But I'm sure he will have fun."
"I put in a job application for a new job. I am fairly certain that my credentials are enough to get me the job.	What type of job is it?"
"I was, I go in next Tuesday. I am pretty excited for them to give me the job.	Excited for you. Is it a pretty demanding job?"
"Me too, we shall see. Now the waiting begins!	I got a call about job with a good company that is in my line of work.	That's great! I have a friend who got a job with a company that is in his line of work recently."
"No, but I have the necessary experience, and I'm optimistic that it will work out.	That is great, you must be really excited, but also know that the right person is always in demand!"
"I went to the petstore with my dog and he had an accident in front of everyone. He had the saddest look on his face.	That's sad. Did he get hurt or just miss?"
"He did, the clerk walked over, told him it was ok and gave him a treat.	What happened in the accident?"
"I had a video job interview. That was a new experience.	How did it go"
"I'm not sure. It was a little awkward and stressful.	I bet that was!  Were you nervous about it?"
"Sure, that's ok. And thank you.	What was awkward and stressful about it?"
"I've been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and the pain is horrible. The problem is that the medicine that my doctor wants me to take has side effects worse that the pain.	I am so sorry to hear that. You should probably find a different doctor."
"Maybe, I haven't been back because I can't afford to go right now. I've just been dealing with the pain.	Oh my that's really bad! I really hope you can get some answers to your pesky pain!"
"It suck.Hopefully we can both get coverage soon.	My son got picked to be on the soccer team that he was on last year!	Wow! That's great!"
"He is!  Especially since last year's team won the Opening Day Tournament and then won the Regular Season title!	That's so awesome, how old is he?!  He must look so good."
"Yeah!  We had a group of really talented kids, and some very good [and patient] coahes!	The other day, my three year old didn't know I was paying attention to her while she was playing with the dog. I overheard her trying to teach the dog how to count to ten.	Oh no! That must have been frightening, I can imagine how the dog felt!"
"Yes, I thought that was pretty good for a three year old. When I asked her about it she said they were playing school. Haha.	Haha, that's cute, sounds like a fun day at school"
"I'm very proud of her.	That's a nice surprise!  Did she enjoy it?"
"I babysat and worked odd jobs all summer when i was younger to save up and buy a sega dreamcast.	That's really nice! I used to also play a lot of video games when I was a kid, but I never got into them. I ended up buying the SNES instead!"
"Yep, i've never looked forward to something so much in my life. I still have the dreamcast as well.	I love the SNES version, I played it a lot as a kid"
"I'm gonna need your support here, because I'm going through something a little bit rough, okay?	I'm here for you."
"I'm 29 years old and I woke up to find that I'd wet the bed last night. I'm...not even sure how. I didn't drink a whole lot before bed or anything.	Oh no that's rough. I hope you feel better. Drink lots of water and take some Gatorade."
"Should I see a therapist or anything? Is this indicative of some deep-seated problem that I'm not aware of?	I'm not sure what other people may have had as far as deep- rooted problems but I've never wet the bed before! I think you might have just woke up to a random number on the lottery ticket, lol!"
"My Uncle Jebodiah is always looking out for me. He recently told me that he had a special concoction that if I drank it, it would cure my herpes.	Well, that sounds like a pretty awesome uncle...and I suppose as time passed, it probably didn't really work. But, at least it was something you were willing and able to try, and that your uncle knew about."
"Listen, my Uncle Jeb wouldn't do me dirty like that. You may call it """"""snake oil"""""" but I call it the miracle cure this world needs. After all, it worked.	I am so happy you found that oil"
"My cat was kept overnight at the vets recently. I was so worried!	I bet! Did they find anything wrong with him?"
"She's fine now! They found out it was something minor after x-rays. I was so relieved.	aww, that's great! i love cats, they are so sweet and devoted"
"My car broke down on a busy highway the other day. There were so many cars zooming past me, it was scary!	Oh my, I hope you weren't hurt!  Did the police come?"
"My brother had to pick me up. He had to pull up behind me on the curb. It felt dangerous!	oh man. that sounds super scary"
"Look, can we just be honest with each other for a second? Having ebola shouldn't mean that I have to be grounded and miss out on my chance to walk on the moon during the upcoming lunar missions.	I agree, I am so sick over it too."
"I saw one, and he said if I gave him $25,000 he would clear me for flight, but I don't have that kind of money just lying around. It's a real bummer. Now I just have to do super boring NASA desk work like tracking comets. Lame.	Maybe you could talk to a salesperson, they usually know what they are talking about"
"I am obsessive about being ready for anything	Me too! It seems like an eternity waiting to accomplish something!"
"I don't know.  I just see stuff in the grocery store and think I like that food and buy it because it is on sale.  Even if I already have it!	That's pretty smart!  It makes you smart to always be prepared and to never let hindsight or research take over your life"
"My girlfriend's leg was bitten off by a bull shark last summer.	Wow, that's brutal. Were you scared?"
"She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her, then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.	Wow that's so cruel of them to do that."
"It was swallowed whole, unfortunately. I just hope the shark seasoned it properly. I won't stand for underprepared human thigh meat. Gordon Ramsay wouldn't have it, and neither will I.	I forgot about plans that I had made with my mother over the weekend.	Was everything cancelled, or do they just take their sweet time making them?"
"I called her right up and we rescheduled! I felt so bad though.	That happened. Don't feel bad. It happens."
"I was talking to a British friend of mine and trying to explain why our president feels compelled to tweet	I'm curious. Why would he feel the need to do that?"
"They think someone needs to take his phone away	That is strange, since he is a Brit...but I suppose it makes total sense given our relationship with Trump"
"I was looking through the attic and found a box of childhood toys. They brought back so many memories!	What a nice thing for the holidays!"
"It was nice to find them all and think back to those simpler times	I know that must be very nostalgic"
"The last trip I took to Chicago was by plane.	That sounds like a fun trip"
"I had! I love chicago.  The flight is nice and short too, though I wasn't feeling well.	That is good to know! I am in Florida and was scared to fly."
"I think my electrolytes were off, I actually fainted on the plane and they made a whole to-do about it.	My university is posting live stream of students moving in and I was reminiscing about when I studied abroad in college	What are you going to do there?"
"I studied in Venice Italy and travelled all over Europe	That sounds like fun!"
"I won a storage shed auction last Monday and found my grandmother's old glass eye in a steamer trunk inside of the shed. Really reminded me of her and how much I miss her.	That's so sweet!  That's one of the most beautiful things I've heard all day!"
"Rita May. She used to mess with me by popping it out and showing me her empty eye socket just to get a laugh while she got drunk off of bourbon. Those were such good times.	I've always wanted an empty eye. That's so cool! I bet you really appreciated her."
"I'm pretty excited for the upcoming Halloween season.	Me too. I like the candy outfits. What's your favorite Halloween costume?"
"Well In September, Universal Studios starts their Halloween Horror Nights events, after dark!  It's so much fun I can't wait to grab tickets.	Sounds like a lot of fun! Halloween is one of my favorites!"
"I was loyal to the same company for 10 years.	That's great!  In which company did you loyalty?  In which area>"
"Nice. I wasn't rewarded though. They laid me off.	That is bad. Why didn't you get rewarded?"
"I told a lie to my mother.	What was the lie?"
"I was about school. And I eventually confessed.	That was very courageous. Was it a good or bad lie?"
"I got a job after a long period of unemployment.	That's great!  Did you find a good job or is the job really hard to get into?"
"Yes. I was very happy to be gainfully employed.	That's amazing!  It's nice to hear people can be excited for the good of society sometimes.  Did you get a raise, too?"
"I was in a car accident. Both cars were totaled.	Oh no!  How are you feeling now?"
"They were running from the police. It was nerve rattling.	That's nuts! What happened? Were they okay?"
"So my family surprised me this year with a party for my birthday.	That sounds really nice! Did they get everything all right for it?"
"They got me the new shoes I've been wanting. I was so elated and had such a good time!	Wow. That sounds like a good surprise."
"I had a job interview. The guy really knew his stuff.	Nice! Did you get it as job of your choice?"
"Yes, really smart and easy to talk to.	Nice! Did you get it?"
"I don't know yet.	Our power went off the other night. We were without it until morning!	Oh no! I hope you didn't miss anything."
"Someone crashed into the power line I think. It was so quiet and felt pretty spooky.	Oh no! I hope you and your family were okay? That can be super unsettling!"
"I bought a raffle ticket for a charity where I have a 1/500 chance of winning a car	That's pretty cool. What charity?"
"Yes.  They were $100 but they only sell 500 tickets.  And the money raised goes to breast cancer research	What! How much do the tickets end up worth if you won one?"
"jumpfortherose.com	Someone helped me move.	Good for you! Moving can be so stressful."
"Yes, and I paid them with beer. I was thankful because I had a toe injury.	Did they fix your tire?"
"I bought a powerball ticket last week but did not win	Sorry to hear that. What was the prize?"
"I would have bought a new car and a house perhaps.  But I lost :-(	I know how that feels. I wish I had your luck.  Good job saving up."
"Yes.  Maybe next time I will win!	I spent Saturday night playing Lord of the Rings Online.	That must of sounded really awesome."
"It is good, but I sometimes wonder if I'm trading real life for a fantasy world.	That is interesting I have never heard of that game before."
"I am so mad that our politicians won't do something to stop Russian hacking	That is very true, they don;t even try to hide it anymore"
"Yes.  The Republicans just don't seem to care about our country any more and I am so mad that Putin owns Trump	I agree. The Republicans really have nothing better to do with the American people than to keep him in check.  It's sad that they lost the 2008 elections because of that."
"My goldfish died.	Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that!"
"For 4 years. I'm bummed.	That's so sad. I'm really sorry about that, how old was he/she?"
"Not yet.	I had an unprofessional job interview.	How did it go?"
"The receptionist ignored me, and my interviewer was not prepared.	That sounds rough. Did you eventually get the job?"
"My computer crashed while I was working on a project.	That's not good. Did it take long to fix it?"
"I did. I hadn't saved, and I forgot to set up autosave. It was very frustrating.	I hate when that happens!"
"My favorite team blew a big lead in the playoffs. It was like drinking sour milk.	That sounds terrible. What was your favorite part of it?"
"I hate when teams choke. It makes me sick.	Oh I hear you! I'm a Reds fan, you?"
"I woke up this morning and my eye is itchy and my right eyelid is drooping	Oh no, is it swollen shut? Maybe it needs to see someone to see what the issue with the retina is?"
"yeah I am going to see what it seems like tomorrow - not sure if something got in it that scratched it or what	Oh no. I hope it's nothing."
"Yeah I will if it does not get better quickly	Me and my family went to see a magic show for the first time today.	Oh how cool. What was the show?"
"I didn't catch his name, but he pulled a rabbit out of his hat. Classic trick, but I'll never forget it!	What show was it?"
"I have a job interview tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it.	How do you feel? Do you think you are ready?"
"Yes. It seems like a great opportunity.	I hope it goes well for you!"
"I scored well on an aptitude test.	How'd you do it??"
"I had a few drinks. I felt good.	Thats great!  Did you celebrate"
"So today my mother brought over a whole week of meals to help me out.	Wow, what a nice gesture. What did you guys make?"
"Yes, she's always helping me out! I am so thankful for her she's an amazing mother.	Wow that is very nice of her!  You are lucky to have such a good mother.  Do you often thankful for her?"
"So I moved away from my parents not too long ago. It's been a big change.	How is that working out for you"
"Out of state. I'm by myself now, so it's pretty quiet! I miss them a lot.	That sounds lonely.  How far did you move?"
"My oldest child needed braces but her health insurance wouldn't cover the expense. It was close to 4000 dollars and we did not have that kind of money at the time.	That's too bad. I am sure that was tough, but I am glad you had the means to do it"
"Yes they do. My aunt paid half of the cost for us and didn't has for any of it back because she knew we needed the help.	That is very kind of your aunt."
"I was sitting on the couch after a long day taking care of work and all the mommy stuff the other day.	Aww.  I know the feeling of taking care of kids during the day.  Did you have a pull out game?"
"It was! My family was happy and together. Chatting and watching tv. Everything just felt right.	Sounds wonderful! What was the stuff you were doing? I need some company in the evenings."
"My husband used to work out of town in a different state Sunday through Thursday.	What was his/her desk job?"
"Yeah, he does work hard. Even thought my children were with me and we kept our usual routines, I was miserable when he was gone. I would cry after he left every Sunday. Luckily now, he has a job where he is home everyday by supper time.	That's good! I am glad he is able to keep his commitment and get to spend time together."
"We really are, he brings out the best in me.	I didn't have a car to get to and from work, so my parents actually let me just keep theirs for a bit!	Wow that's lucky of them! You must've really grateful people!"
"Yeah it was so giving of them to leave it to me for so long and helped me a ton!	That was very nice of them! You are lucky to have such a caring family!"
"While driving today I went past my grandma's old house. She passed last year.	That's really sad. You must have felt sentimental you got passed down to you"
"Oh for sure. Good feelings, but I also miss her so much.	I'm so sorry. That's a hard thing to deal with. I bet that brought a tear to your eye?"
"I went outside to get my paper this morning. Someone had ran over my mailbox!	I hate when that happens! Did you catch them?"
"No, it's completely demolished! I'm feeling pretty annoyed.	That's nuts! Did they get charged?"
"My sister is a journalist and she got her first big story published in the paper today!	That's awesome, what was it on."
"It is! It's a really big deal and I couldn't be happier for her.	That's great she gets to do that! I bet she's full of joy right now!"
"So my partner gave me the biggest surprise this week.	Oh nice! How did it come out?"
"He got us a trip to Hawaii! I couldn't believe it, I am so elated!	Wow that's awesome! Hawaii sounds amazing!"
"I finally went and adopted a cat last month and go way more than I expected!	that is awesome what kind of cat is it?"
"Well it was only supposed to be her, but we found out she was pregnant! She popped out a whole litter of adorable.	That sounds adorable! Congratulations on your adoption :) What kind of cat is she?"
"I had to leave town last week and that meant leaving my pets who are my babies. I needed someone who could take care of them properly.	That's really sweet, I hope you guys had fun and are doing good things again soon!"
"It is very hard! The only one who I'd let do it was my sister and she did an amazing job.	That's sad to hear about. I hope things work out for you in the end."
"So I finally decided to take my dog for his first dog park visit.	How'd he do?"
"It's hard to tell! He refused to leave my side the entire time and just watched the other dogs play.	Oh no! Did you scare the little feller?"
"Im embarrassed to admit I forgot to pick up my brother from worth the other day after agreeing to	What happened?"
"Ha ha, he was a little miffed. He got over it though when I stopped and got him ice cream on the way back though! I felt like such a jerk.	Haha well thats just classic brother thing to do"
"I finally took the plunge and decided to go back to school this year.	Good for you! It's such an exciting time!"
"I start next week! I was super hesitant at first, but I'm so glad I'm making myself do it.	Going back can be a bit scary. But it can be a lot of work (and money, I suppose)."
"I was going through some stuff and found a box of jewelry my grandparents had gifted me through the years.	What kind?"
"Yeah, it really made me think of them and old times.	That is nice. I bet thats brought back a lot of memories too"
"I recently had a shop fix my car. They worked so fast!	That's great. Makes working hard enjoyable."
"I was able to go home, but I realize now that I didn't even have to	That's great! I had to have shop do a bunch of things when i was younger. You're lucky to have that saved up!"
"My husband is going through the process of quitting smoking on top of dealing with drama from his parents. He is having a hard time.	Oh that's a tough situation! I'm sorry. But he should be strong for you all, quitting definitely won't help him in the long run."
"They aren't being supportive at all, but that's not surprising, that don't support him very well in anything. I just wish I could make it better for him, but I can't	That's really rough. He sounds really depressed. Maybe you should go and talk to them?"
"I have some great friends. One of them drove me to the airport tomorrow	Well, great friends really are worth the drive - and are a blessing to have on such a short time!"
"Yes I am, they are great	I bet you had a ton of fun."
"We just found out the person working in our accounting department has been stealing money from our company for years.	That is horrible! Did they do it on an off chance or did they just want to get a dollar?"
"Yes, it just makes me sick to my stomach. You think you know someone but the whole time they are stealing you blind. I don't get some people	that is horrible i hate when that happens you just got a tip stolen from you blind people are the worst"
"I miss high school. My girlfriend was the best	I can understand.  Do you have friends now?"
"That's great. College was also fun	I felt that way as well when I separated from my highschool.  College just wasn't fair."
"I recently bid farewell to a good friend. I miss her	That's sad. How long were friends for?"
"Thank you, that means a lot. I will see her again	thats great, how long have you been friends with her?"
"I lost my car keys. I'm such a fool!	Oh man did the police have any leads?"
"That's pretty funny, and makes me feel better. This is the first time I've lost my keys so I hope to keep it that way!	I hope they didn't steal anything"
"I came home the other day and my roommate had a friend over. I've only seen him with a friend over once in my 3.5 years of living here.	Did you treat him to something really special?  It's always nice to see someone special after they left their childhood friends behind"
"Yeah I sure was, he seems to like this one much better than the last one he had over. He couldn't wait for that first guy to leave.	That is a strange situation.  Did the friend treat him well or were they not good at all?  I am guessing he was mad that he didnt get to leave sooner."
"One of my co-worker came and asked me a lot of really weird questions about my supervisor. It seemed suspicious so I pretty much told her I didn't know any of the answers to her questions. I don't think she likes my supervisor.	did you say something to the supervisor?"
"Yeah I figured it was, so I just played dumb and let my supervisor know. My supervisor has always been good to me.	That's great that you played nice with her. It's nice when you can back that up."
"Man there aren't many people I would give my last couple hundred dollars to, with one notable exception.	What about a bank account?"
"My buddy Stefan. He used it to print hundreds of bootleg concert posters. We sold them and netted $2000 a piece!	Wow, that is really lucky!"
"I finished first in a race. I feel like gold	Nice, what kind of race was it?"
"Yes! It was my first victory. All my hard work is paying off	That's great! Was first place a marathon, or a bike race?"
"Some of my friends told me that they had a big surprise for me. They know I hate surprises, but I complied and let the blindfold me and drive me out to the location.	I like to drive around in my blindfold too. I hope I don't get road rage like you do lol."
"They had decided to pool their money together and get me one big present together. It was a flying lesson at the local airport.	wow that is a big surprise, I would feel the same way. Where did they get the gift?"
"I found an old photo album at my grandma's house that had pictures of me when I was a kid	Do you miss your family and friends?"
"Yeah, it did. I really miss the 90s. Everything seemed a lot simpler in those days	I agree.  I love looking through my old photos albums"
"When I was in middle school, I had a friend come over to ride horses with me. After riding my mother pressured me to get on a horse bareback I wasn't comfortable riding. She made such a big scene that I got on to make her stop.	That's so cool. I bet your mom was proud"
"Yes, the horse took off running and I got thrown into a metal fence. My mother then proceeded to yell and me and make fun of me for trusting her. She told me that I should never trust anyone not even my own parents, it was really embarrassing to get yelled at in from my friend. Afterwards my ribs hurt for 2 months.	I hate bullies, they are so bad!"
"My friend really wanted me to go rollerblading with him, but I haven't been rollerblading since I was a little kid. I didn't want to roll into a car.	It's definitely safer than most sports! Are you okay?"
"We went, but it was still pretty terrible because I felt completely uncomfortable and was bent over the whole time ready to catch myself.	Hahaha I can understand that"
"My husband is on the road a lot, I hardley ever see him.	Where did you guys meet? Is he still very close to you?"
"Yes, its hard but I try to remember he does it for our family! I have been trying to adapt to enjoying alone time.	What type of hobbies do he have?"
"I have an interview for a job that I don't feel qualified for	How come, are you scared of the interview? Do you feel that you can't handle the pressure?"
"I will try. I'm a pretty anxious person in general so it's hard	Don't feel anxious!  It's perfectly valid to feel anxious in an interview.  Just be confident that the questions they ask will be helpful to you!"
"I'm moving in a few months to a new state, I'm starting to feel nervous.	Why were you nervous, is it a nice place?"
"To my husband hometown so it'll be new for me but he is excited to be back near family.	That is exciting! Have you met before?"
"I saw a dog get hit by car today on the highway.	Oh no.  What happened to him??"
"It was pretty tramatic, I still see the dog getting hit in my head and the sound. No, I was on my way to work, I couldn't stop :(	That's pretty sad. Have you thought about getting the dog yourself?"
"I can't even begin to tell you how nervous I was about my first tattoo.	How old was it?"
"Definitely! I get lightheaded when I see my own blood, and my pain threshold was low at the time. It turned out great though, and now I have several!	I'm glad it turned out well. I have no idea what my tattoo looks like, but i'm glad you had a nice time with it"
"I love my husband! He has been so sweet this week!	That is really good to here! What has he been doing to make you so kind!"
"He knew I had a rough day today so he brought home my favourite wine and Taco Bell! It's the little things :)	That sounds like a nice husband :)  What kind of wine and what kind of taco Bell?  I'm happy to hear it!"
"It's been a great week!	Why, whats happening?"
"I got a promotion at work that I wasn't expecting!	Congratulations! That is awesome!"
"Music is a powerful thing. Sometimes it feels like it can transport you to another time and place. You know what I mean?	I know exactly what you are talking about! Sometimes I feel likeMusic brings me to a different time period. Sometimes even space!"
"Who can deny it? My dad passed away 2 years ago. Sometimes I put on his old records and imagine what it would have been like to hang out with him in the 70s.	oh no im so sorry for your loss, i know exactly what you mean"
"I was feeling kind of down so I ended up snuggling with a stuffed rabbit I have. It brought back a lot of good old memories.	That sounds really comfortable! I love stuffed animals! What's the name of the rabbit?"
"Awe yeah thanks. He's pretty soft even though he some derpy eye that point in opposite directions. Brings me a lot of comfort and reminds me that someone cares.	That is really cute! I love stuffed animals."
"My dog got hit by a car.	Oh no! Is he ok though?"
"He did not live. I've never felt so sad before.	Oh no. Is he okay now?"
"Some random guy was in my backyard, I didn't realize before I looked outside that I was missing pants.	Oh wow! Did it look pretty big?"
"Turns out he was the cable guy fixing a wire. Still mad he didn't ask permisson first.	Hahahah that's so funny, did he do it without permission?"
"My family is still hasn't recovered from the untimely passing of my father two years ago.	That sucks to hear about. I hope they are doing okay"
"My siblings and I are managing, and have found some peace. My mother is a different story. It was just so sudden and unexpected.	What happened to him? I'm sorry!"
"I've got a week off from work. Time to sleep in and binge watch my favorite shows.	That sounds like a great relaxing time! I'm jealous! You should go out and enjoy the weekend and get a nice comfy blanket!"
"I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I'm rewatching it for the third time	I watch that show too! It is so funny. It feels like I'm in high school again"
"I was really stressed out and grad school and had no choice but to drop out to keep my sanity.	That's unfortunate. What are you getting your degree in?"
"That is what I was thinking at the time, but I've been having a really tough time finding a job where I can advance into a higher position. I always seem to get positions with no mobility.	Do you think you have a realistic shot at getting into a higher position at your next job?"
"I tripped on some steps in front of a whole bunch of people on my way to class.	Are you hurt?"
"It was pretty humiliating. I fell flat on my face.	Did you cry?"
"My boyfriend is sick. He can't eat much so I made some soup for him	Good for him. soup is good for many things."
"I made chicken noodle soup.	soup is a good soup"
"I had a meeting last week where I gave a presentation over the wrong documentation and no one said anything until after the meeting.	Oh no.  That's not cool at all!  What did you do after they said they noticed?"
"After I figured out what I did, I sure was. Ate at my cube ever since I don't even want to make eye contact with anyone.	That's really cool of you! Did it take a lot of time?"
"I have a really big meeting next week. I have rehearsed what I am to go over all this past week and plan to practice a little more this weekend.	That's really exciting! Good luck to you!"
"It's a meeting presenting a new product to the board. Big stuff and big money for the company.	Wow! Good luck! I hope all goes well!"
"I caught my boyfriend texting his ex	That's terrible! How are you feeling about it?"
"It was definitely a bit flirty. I think he misses being with her	Oh no. Does he think she is cheating?"
"I know I broke up with my ex, but I can't help but feel irritated when he talks about going on dates.	Those are bad dates too"
"We actually get along really well and are much better friends than a couple. I guess I still just get a littler territorial, i think he does too.	That is probably true and you still miss him a lot."
"I can't wait to see my final grades. I think I got all A's this semester.	Woo hoo! That's awesome!!!  You must be so excited!  Where are you getting your grades?"
"On Monday. I'm going to treat myself if I did well	That's awesome! I hope you did great and crush the last few nights of studying!"
"I was very upset when I found my kitten today.	A kitten found its way back through the dog door and probably hit a person or something? How old is your cat?"
"No, I had to put it down. It ate a poisonous plant. He should not have been outside.	Oh no, that is heartbreaking."
"I cried a bit, but kept it together for my little girl because she had let him out.	I enjoy visiting the nursing home on occasion.	That's really neat! I love it when you can spend some time out there with family and have an awesome experience."
"Not really, I take my daughter to see them, so many of them have no visitors at all.	Visiting nursing homes is very special. It's an incredibly beautiful place to visit."
"She likes to bake, so we take them what she makes :)	That's fair, it can be nice to see your daughter happy!"
"She is pretty good for an eleven year old, better than I was.	Wow. You are pretty lucky. I am sure you are great parent!"
"I had a secret and went to my mother to confide in her, as well as get off my chest. I know she would never betray my secret and can always count on her.	That's so sweet of her!  You're a lucky person."
"Yes, I sure do! There aren't many people you can feel that way with and I am so grateful!	Sounds like a great secret to keep.  How did you discover the full extent of her love."
"My son applied to a prestigious college and the wait killed us. I was anxious and nervous waiting to see if he was accepted!	Oh that must have taken forever!  Did you get the acceptance?"
"He did! He's in his 3rd year, going to be an Aerospace Engineer, so we are very proud of him.	That's amazing!  I'm so proud of him!  3rd years is a very hard goal to set for anyone!"
"My sister passed away several years ago. She took her life, and my mother and I found her right after she did it. This was very painful, traumatic and hard for us all.	oh my god i'm so sorry to hear this! My grandmother passed away 3 month after he was diagnosed with athereatics"
"It didn't really seem to sink in for my mother for awhile, she was in denial. But, it was so hard when it did. I went into a depression for awhile, as she was my only sibling and we were very close.	That sucks, my sister is getting older. She is 50 now. I'm sorry for the loss."
"When my son first started college, I felt so much love and affection, but it was definitely hard to see him go! I was very proud though.	You must felt so much happiness with his college career."
"He went to the University of Alabama in Huntsville. It's focused on science, engineering, etc. He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer. It's great to see him go for his dreams!	Amazing!  I am proud of your son also!  Does he have a major in science?"
"We went on vacation a few weeks ago and went to the beach, It was so relaxing and great. I really enjoyed the time with my family.	I love the beach! I'm glad you got to enjoy it."
"That's great! I'm sure you earned it, just like we do. It's so good to get some time away from the hustle and bustle of life!	I agree, I get so relaxed and free with life sometimes."
"I am looking forward to next week! My husband has been out of town on business for several weeks and comes home next weekend!	What do you guys plan to do?"
"I am going to cook a special meal and see if he wants to go out, just us two. I know he will like that.	That sounds wonderful. I hope he comes home with a new girlfriend!"
"My husband has been out of town a few weeks for work but is coming back next weekend. I have a surprise night planned for just us. I am optimistic and sure he will really enjoy it.	That's good! How long will he be gone?"
"Thanks! We've been married almost 23 years but I try to keep things fun and spend time together.	What do you have planned for this night?"
"My son went back to college recently and it had me feeling a bit nostalgic. I could just picture him starting Kindergarten and it seemed not so long ago!	I remember when my son went to college. They grow so quickly!"
"Yes, very. But, time sure has flown by with him growing up. I can just see his little blonde head when he was 5 and just starting school!	True. They grow up so fast! I have a granddaughter that's almost 5. It goes by in a blink of an eye. So many changes and adventures."
"I was promoted to a Team Leader and I felt very secure I could do well at the job. I had years of experience and was ready for a leadership role.	That is great, I am happy to hear that!"
"Yes, thank you! I had worked very hard through the years, and I felt that I earned it, and would do well at it.	that is good, it is always a goal of mine, and theres nothing like family!"
"There was an incident where one of my back neighbors called my young son a name and made fun of him. I was so mad, beyond angry!	Oh my, please don't let them upset you! If they continue to do it call the police, because that's hate crime!"
"Yes, and she had two children of her own, similar in age. Her son also weighed more than mine! She did it because my son rode his bike through the corner of her yard as rode around the circle, that made her mad! Can you believe that??	I can believe that!"
"Last week my granddaughter started school for the first time. I worried about her the entire day.	Oh that's exciting! Is she excited?"
"It turns out she loves and and I was a mess for 8 hours for nothing.	What a precious moment! How did she grow so much in such a short amount of time?"
"I always try and plan everything in advance to bring everything we need when we go on vacation. We recently went on our honeymoon and I didn't do very well this time. Ugh!	Did everything turn out OK on your trip?"
"I forgot everything. I guess I was so excited about the wedding, I totally failed at packing this time. Oh well, it was still fun.	It happens to everyone, dont feel bad!"
"One day I was visiting a friend and her boyfriend came up and kissed me, while I was waiting for my friend to return from another room! It was sneaky and repulsed me!	That sounds so disgusting! How long ago was this?"
"I didn't....only because of her situation. She had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson, she wasn't working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him. She already suspected he was with other women, and stayed.....	That's really disgusting!  I don't know why some people are willing to do that.  It isn't right."
"The other night I was home alone and all of a sudden I heard someone knocking at the door really loud and they wouldn't stop. I was so scared.	What happened?"
"No, I ignored them and they finally went away. I was just about to call the police before they left though. I hope that doesn't happen again.	Who are they?"
"I was trying to ignore the fact that my 50th birthday was coming up but my family decided to throw me a surprise party.	Wow. You must be so surprised. What did they buy ya?"
"It was so much fun and such a happy night. I'm trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more	That sounds like so much fun! I wish I had a surprise party!"
"A few weeks ago, my husband and I had a big argument. I said some pretty hurtful things, and wished I hadn't. I felt very bad and disappointed in myself afterwards.	I am so sorry you went through that! Are things better now between the two of you?"
"Yes, that's true. I tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things I regret later.	Its okay. We all have our bad moments. It's good to realize everyone has their bad moments."
"One night when my kids and I came home, I saw a shadow in my hallway as I came in the back door. I was so scared and was afraid someone had broken in my home.	I would be scared too!!  What did you do?  Did you see it?"
"Yes, and I live out in the country so I wouldn't get a quick response time from emergency vehicles. But, luckily, it turned out to be my shadow!	That's awesome that it turned out to be your shadow!  Did it freak you out?"
"There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do, as I feel it's my part to help those in need, as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.	I'm really happy for you.  Sometimes hard-working people are overlooked and it can make you feel less important."
"Well, homeless people aren't common in my area, so that's why I felt a bit bad about it.	It's ok to give Sometimes you have to live without it"
"When my children were born, it was a rejoicing time for me. I can't think of a time I felt more happiness.	Congratulations. You must have a very happy and joyful time now."
"Yes, I have two children and I feel so blessed to have them. I lucked out and got a boy and girl, both healthy, smart and wonderful.	That's amazing! You're speaking my language right now! I'm so happy to hear you had such an amazing experience and your kids became great adults!"
"I used to work in a place where all my colleagues had different believes to myself. I wanted to stay true to what I believed in, so had to walk away from conversations on many occasions.	Why did you feel like you had to walk away from certain occasions?"
"Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another, just because of their religion or skin color, or where they come from.	I understand that. It can be a little annoying at times, but it's better than being miserable all the time."
"They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that, but chose to keep my mouth shut!	I recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and I was really scared to drive it, especially on the highway.	That's exciting!  Are you excited about driving it?"
"Just a Honda Civic. People drive crazy around here. I don't want to have another car accident like the last one.	Those hondos are like cars from the 50s!  Did you find it difficult to drive?"
"I recently joined a group to help me lose weight. I have so much respect and admire everyone in that group so much.	That's great! It's always nice to be able to have supportive friends!  Keep it up!"
"It has really helped to have their support. I am so grateful for them	That's great to have a group like that. Keep it up and you'll be on the right path soon!"
"A few years ago I applied for US citizenship. To succeed you have to pass a Civics test. I was so terribly nervous!	Did they give you a chance?  I've always wanted to go into politics, and have a shot at it :)"
"I passed! Turns out you only had to answer three questions correctly. But they have 50 to choose from so you have to study the lot!	Congratulations!  What was the test about?  How do you think the test determined your national eligibility?"
"Thank you. My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!	I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.	Oh, what wonderful times we live with."
"It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel, if someone's taken the time to write, I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?	Naw! You're right, because if they were thoughtful and wrote properly, it doesn't matter what the writer had to say."
"That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!	That is a great way to look at it"
"I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with, lol.	It's always a bit of fun to think about the things that you didn't have before you become a parent!"
"When I was entering the store it was really slippery.	Slipped on ice cream?"
"It had been raining , so I ran across the parking lot in to the store. I slid about 3 feet.	That is so scary! Are you ok?"
"I was fine, just felt like every one was looking at me.	I am feeling a bit guilty about keeping a secret for my friend.	Why, what was the secret?  Do you want to talk about it>"
"I don't want to out her to her husband, usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.	I'm sorry, secrets are always hard! Have you talked to your husband about this? Maybe he can comfort you."
"Thanks, I am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out.	I feel kind of blue today, they announced the parts for the annual play.	A part of what play?"
"I did, and it is a good one, just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.	Oh, no! That's never fun when something good like that happens, especially if you're trying to build suspense! What was your favorite part of the play?"
"It is, my friend got it, or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.	I'm teaching my daughter how to drive, and so far, so good!	Wow, you must be so proud of her!"
"She is!  At first, though, she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road, so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.	Slow is not bad. Has she started drivingpool?"
"Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.	Wow, that's impressive. She sound like a very determined person."
"I do what I can where I can.  Can't wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!	That is awesome! I am happy for you guys!"
"My house is a mess and I've got people coming over later on this evening.	Don't worry, you will look fabulous and save a ton of time!"
"I'm going to try to.  If worst comes to worse, I'll just toss everything in my back bedroom, shiny up the floors and hope for the best!  *chuckle*	That's funny, you almost sound like me last month.  It's hard to clean up after everyone when they make a habit of doing it when I'm not home."
"My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.	That's unfortunate, but lucky to have a brother you can count! What was wrong with his house?"
"We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.	That's so great! I'm so happy for you! I'm going through something right now myself, and I'm so close to having to sell a house too! I can see it happening!"
"We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.	Aw, that's great! Sounds like you have a great family. Sounds like you have a great friend too!"
"Don't be! There are many, many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :)	I understand. Are there things that you are both are not as close as you thought?"
"My son was in advance placement and honors during high school. He went to a prestigious college after, going for as an Aerospace Engineer. He never ceases to astonish me with his intelligence and admire me with how hard he works to pursue his dreams.	You must be very proud of him!"
"I am quite proud, thank you! I also have a teenage daughter that is very smart and an amazing artist, (which I don't know where she gets that talent). They really impress me with amazing they are!	My son was also placed ahead in certain activities at his school. He is very good at math. He really blew me away with his math and understanding of the material. He is very forthright and listens to what he says. He can also use the internet to help him along!"
"Going out today to learn a new route for my job and I'm hoping that I don't get lost.	You must be excited! Where will you be doing this?"
"I got the assignment yesterday, and I told myself that I'd go drive around it today and tomorrow.  My boss is supposed to ride along with me the first week, and then after that I'll be on my own.	Sounds good. Where are you going?"
"I was over here in the US when my Grandma passed in Scotland. I was so upset - nobody could get hold of me to tell me and her funeral was over before I knew about it.	Oh I'm so sorry. I've lost both of mine. It's hard when you don't really have anyone to talk to."
"Only for funerals, unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life, I'm afraid.	I'm sorry to hear that.  I'm in the UK - my grandmother died in Hawaii not long after she lived here.  How old were you at the time?"
"Yes I was. I didn't come to the US until I was in my 30s. Didn't expect my Grandma to pass the minute I got here, but she was 96, so it shouldn't have been such a surprise!	Oh no! I'm sorry for your loss!  I can only imagine how hard that must have been."
"She was as fit as a flea too. She tripped and broke her hip and got a bad infection in the hospital. That's what she died of!	That is so sad to hear about.  I hope it wasn't too serious of an infection.  Is it still treatable?"
"I just bought an Xbox! I've never owned a gaming console before	I am sure you are excited, but you are in for a world of pain and frustration. I would just wait until you get it and try it out!"
"I am! I bought Halo and am ready to ride.	Sweet. I just got the one too. I love it. Halo is my favorite video game of all time"
"My father passed away 2 years ago, but my mother lives in my neighborhood now. I'm so thankful she lives close by and still here with us. She's such a wonderful mother.	Thats so wonderful! i'm so sorry for your loss! :( I recently lost both my parents in a car wreck. I know how hard that is. :("
"I'm sorry to hear that, I know it's so hard to lose a parent. I think we take them for granted when we are younger, but I am blessed she's still here.	I'm sorry to hear about your loss as well. At some point you have to recognize their greatness."
"I am as happy as a clam right now. My neighbors are away for the weekend!	That is awesome. I love being able to have a little space while they are away"
"The live upstairs and constantly thump around, screeching into their cellphones. And then there's the video games...	That is so awesome! I bet you will enjoy it!"
"Oh I am, believe me I am. The world seems like a calm, serene place where everything is just right!	My friend from across the continent came over yesterday! I was so happy about it	Oh awesome. Was there a special occasion?"
"We ended up hanging out and recording some audio. He is a voice actor	That's cool! How long has it been since you seen him?"
"I was out for a walk one night in a suburb of Boston when we heard the cries of a young animal. It was a baby kitten, with no collar, in a window well.	That's so heartbreaking!  I hope the kitten was fine, did you take it home to feed it?"
"We actually did, and ended up adopting him. He was still so young he needed formula, but now he is thriving!	That's awesome!  I love babies, and babies don't have to be scared of other people!  What kind of cat do you have?"
"I felt a need to help when the baby bird was by itself	aww that was really nice of you, baby birds are the best"
"I did not, I was little but I think I put it back into a tree	awww. that was sweet of you."
"Waiting to see if I would graduate was pretty unnerving	Was it a difficult class?"
"Yep, had to take a class online over the summer but it worked out	What class was it on?"
"I forgot my mother-in-law's birthday this year and can't look her in the eye!	Oh my goodness! I'm so sorry! Did you ask around and see if she's calendar able?"
"I just feel so embarrassed - she never forgets my birthday. And my husband was away and didn't remind me :(	Oh wow! I can't imagine what that is like."
"You're right. She's a very forgiving person and I've never forgotten before. It's on St. Paddy's day for heavens sake - how could I forget???	I was the only one wearing pajamas at this party, not my greatest moment	I'm sure nobody noticed"
"I thought that it was a pajama party haha, never worn a dress before, maybe that's the secret	How long were you out of the party?"
"I had some trippy nightmares as a kid, now I don't really have dreams	Yeah, I've been there. It's not a good thing"
"Yeah, it was like I was tied to a chair and a huge thing was staring at me, pretty weird	That would be really terrifying.  I can relate.  I'm terrified to have dreams that are too realistic.  It gives me so many nightmares!  What techniques can you suggest to deal with them?"
"I didn't realize that stealing was bad until I realized how it made me feel afterwards	I could see how it might make you feel bad.  What happened that made you feel that way?"
"No, I was scared to get charged, but I stopped after that	It's not that bad in the grand scheme of the world, it's stealing that's worse."
"I was at a meditation retreat last year for 10 days and I can say that I experienced a better feeling there than I could ever remembe	That's really good to hear! How did you do?"
"Yeah, thankfully there's an app for that - Headspace (no I am not sponsored)	I'm not familiar with Headspace, but if it helps you focus, then it would work out pretty good for you!"
"I am really looking forward to going away for the holidays.	Me too! where are you goiing?"
"I want to go see the Harry Potter land at Universal, the kids will love it.	That sounds like a lot of fun!  Are you going alone or with kids?"
"They love the films, plus getting to ride Hogwarts Express, score!	I'm really hoping my acceptance letter shows up in the mail soon.	When will you hear back?"
"Law School, I'm pretty sure I got in to my first choice, but you never know.	That's amazing! I hope your acceptance letter comes in soon! I had two acceptance letters and three acceptance letters in the last four years... neither worked so I'm hoping mine comes soon too!"
"Thank you, fingers are crossed.	I just ordered a new cookery book and am eagerly awaiting its arrival. I want to delve in and try lots of new recipes!	What kind of cookery do you do"
"I'm vegetarian and cook all sorts of different cuisines - Indian, Italian, American. The only cuisine I'm not good at is Chinese. How about you?	I'm not vegetarian either but I've always loved trying new things. I like Mexican especially. You should totally try it out and let me know if you like it. I bet you will love it. vegetarian btw."
"Have you heard of Mark Bittman's book How to Cook Everything Vegetarian? That's the book I'm waiting impatiently for!	I witnessed the most epic bottle flip in the history of bottle flips at my school	Oh yeah? How old were you at the time?"
"Yee yee, it landed on this little ledge that was super high up.	Did you cry when you saw it happen?"
"My little grandson just came home from the hospital. He was born premature and weighted under 2 pounds.	Oh my goodness! How old is he?!"
"He is doing well, thank you. And we are so thankful everything is ok. It was touch and go for awhile	That is great.  Being ill and pregnant is tough"
"I love my girlfriend. She would never cheat on me	Thats great. How often do you see her"
"I hope to make her my wife some day!	That's great! It's amazing how many people don't view other people as a partner. How does that make you feel when it happens to you?"
"My sister spilled some milk on me. It set me off!	Oh no! That's horrible!"
"It was indeed a mistake. My clothes are fine now.	Uh oh!  Is she going to be upset if you admit to the mistake?"
"I recently did not pay my rent. My land lord has been terrible at providing services	That really sucks.. landlord aren't supposed to provide help for things like that! Landlords should really train their own employees better."
"He decided to start caring and doing his part.	I'm so proud of you!  Not everyone gets lucky like that."
"I'm thankful that I was able to repair my tire before it went flat on my car	That's great! How did it happen?"
"Right, I caught it just as it happened and brought it to the shop, didn't cost as much as I thought it would either.	That is good. How did it happen?"
"I love my friend. She just drove me to class	that was nice of her.. anything special you got in return?"
"I think I am getting her a gift soon!	Well that's nice! What was the class?"
"I stole from my friends when I was a child. I feel terrible about it now	Why did you steal from them?  Did you need money for food?"
"It was some Pokemon cards!	What kind of cards"
"My father almost passed away last year. It was very tough on everyone	Sorry to hear that. How did he die?"
"Yes, he has made a full recovery! It's been a journey	I'm so sorry for your loss!  It's been 4 months since I lost mine, I can't wait to not even think about it"
"I remember when I was a young one. I loved life.	That is nice"
"I do, but maybe not with he same flare as before	yea i know what you mean i was like that too"
"I helped find my friend's cats. She's glad they're back now	Did you rescue or adopt?"
"Yes they both just wandered off when the door was open!	That's really awesome! Have they been lost or found so many times?"
"5	I have no idea what 5 is. Can someone enlighten me please?"
"I recently got an A on my paper. I feel great.	paper Mario?!??? I hope you are happy!!! what are your plans to celebrate?"
"I went swimming recently. I lost my trunks walking out of the pool.	Oh no! How did that happen??"
"Yeah, we all have a good laugh about it now	Oh no! That's pretty funny! Was it a good swim or was it a bad swim?"
"Drinking a gallon of milk in a day wasn't a good idea	Really? gallon? How much dairy did you drink?"
"I wanted to see how hard it would be, turns out my stomach was JUST big enough	How did it feel after you took a sip?  Did you feel sick afterwards?"
"My friend slept with a girl I like. I feel horrible now	That sucks, hope it didn't lead to anything bad"
"No, but I don't think he is my friend any more	That is really bad!  Why did he do it??  She had better things to do."
"I don't like working with managers that try to micro-manage me	How does that usually work out for you?"
"Right, it kind of feels like they're insecure with their abilities while trying to make me feel bad at the same time	I know exactly what you mean! They micro manage me so it never works out and it makes me so bitter when they don't listen"
"Teeth are weird, but also take a lot of upkeep which is sometimes irritating	why do they cost so much?"
"Yeah that's what my dentist says, I'll try	I am glad that you get carette."
"I wake up with chills sometimes for no reason	That's terrible. Have you try Go to sleep with an pillow next time?"
"I think it's from dreams that I'm not able to recall	That's terrible. Have dreams often?"
"I wasn't able to reach my goals in the gym a couple days ago, and it helped me realize where I'm slacking off in other areas	I'm glad to hear it. Keep at it"
"Yeah, it's fun to see how much you can conquer yourself, and it's nice to be able to see how you're changing	That is good to hear!"
"I recently went skydiving. It was a thrilling rush	skydiving sounds like a lot of fun!"
"It was excellent. I feel so alive!	skydiving seems to be such an adrenaline rush."
"I think I will have success in my life. I love life these days!	What makes you so confident?"
"I recently finished a new album I have been working on!	Congratulations. What song did you write?"
"I'm excited to think of all the possibilities that are available to me at the moment	what are you thinking about?"
"Being able to learn basically anything with the internet for one	Yeah that is exciting too"
"I like meditating because it puts things into perspective in a way that I don't usually expect	I agree! I find it helps me relax and clear my head."
"For sure, my mind is pretty energetic	I've heard about meditation a lot. What do you find the benefit from?"
"I've been processing what being lonely feels like, because I want to be able to have fun by myself sometimes	I get that way too! How often do you get to have fun"
"True, and I've felt that way before, but sometimes like a wave of those kinds of feelings hits like I'm not worthy enough and stuff like that, but it's all good	Yeah, sometimes we take those feelings for granted. I'm sorry that you feel that way."
"I'm trying to get over my need to control things, and I find if I just let things happen it feels like a weights been pulled off my shoulders	I'm right there with you. I used to be really scared of the dark but now after trying out a few different techniques I am starting to be a little less scared and have been using them more."
"Right, but things always seem to turn out for the best anyway	I am in the same boat right now.  I have too many emotions going on right now.  Keep trying!"
"I grew up pretty skinny and now that I've grown some muscle I feel a lot more comfortable in my skin	That's great. I think skinny kids need more confidence."
"around 9 months, been pretty slow to make progress but overall it's been solid	That's awesome. I'm glad to here that!  Do you exercise?  Do you diet?"
"I am going to go camping tomorrow! The back's already packed	Where are you going camping?"

"My old house burned down, and I went to check it out, was surreal taking a look around the place	Wow.  It has happened to us so many times.  It is kind of sad that it happened again.."
"Yeah, it was built a long time ago, some kind of electrical fire	Wow that is so crazy! Did it take long to recover?"
"I was truly surprised when I notice my tire got hit by a rock, thought I wouldn't make it to the tire place in time	Did it take long to get to the place?"
"It did not, got it replaced when I dropped it off, pretty lucky	Oh wow. Glad your ok!! Did you have to get it towed home?"
"There was a cat who had string stuck around it so I had to help	That's awful, I'm glad you got the help"
"Yeah, everything turned out fine in the end	That is no good. I bet that was really gross."
"I feel like deepening my connection to God is the most important thing in my life	Connecting to who and to God is something that every Christian must do at some point."
"It's like if I don't get that sorted out I won't be able to live a fulfilling life	Connections are important but what do you mean by connection to god?"
"When I can't take a breather in the day I feel suffocated	That is terrible. I hope that you feel better soon!"
"Right, it's like I can't focus or relax	I know what you mean, I can't stand waiting around waiting for a breather in the day."
"When I was in elementary school I was envious of the kids who were popular!	I can understand that! popular kids have more talent than we do! I was never the best at reading though, so don't take it too seriously. I was never a reader either... always had to be fast!"
"Yeah, I just had trouble socializing is all	I hear you there, kids just have a sweet, innocent way of getting everyone else involved."
"When I do things that are challenging I feel more self-reliant. I recently tried taking an ice bath	I like to do hot baths."
"Yeah, my bath wasn't deep enough, so I didn't get covered all the way!	That's great! How deep was it?  Sometimes when you're in a hurry, you bath extra shallow!  Did it work for you??"
"I'm eating a lot of food to make sure I can lift more weight in the gym next time!	Good job! I need to start eating less food as well."
"I'm taking everything, honey, raw garlic, yogurt, EVERYTHING!	Oh wow, so you're taking in the big meals? That's awesome! I need to get back in the gym myself."
"I don't like scammy sales people, nothing good comes from it	They call them scammers when they talk bad things about other people."

"I went to lunch the other day with my kids. My daughter needed help opening her dipping sauce and of course I did....	Oh no!  Did the whole thing get inside her mouth?  That must have been frustrating."
"They are but when I finally got it open it sprayed me from my waste all the way to my hair!	Oh no! I hope she doesn't feel guilty for something that small!"
"Listening to old artists like they Might Be Giants is my jam	That is awesome, do you listen to a lot of different kinds?"
"Haha, I didn't grow up with them but it's like discovering a gold mine that no one else seems to listen to	What is the song that you are referring to"
"Getting my driver's license was a freeing experience	How did it go?"
"Yeah, that was a while ago, cars are great in a lot of situationsz!	I'm glad to hear that! I've always been more of a car person myself."
"I've had the worst week, someone stole my credit card information.	That's really annoying. Did they get it for any reason?"
"Yes it's been hell, they charged over 15 thousand dollars on it. I hope my identity is fine besides the card.	That's terrible, I hope they get caught and locked up somehow!"
"I was pretty disillusioned when I found out door to door sales wasn't a fun time	That's unfortunate. Do you have any leads on any new activities?"
"I realized that it was unethical in the end!	That's too bad. I guess you have to do what you have to"
"Ugh, I'm so annoyed! My husband went out again with his friends, third time this week.	What a cheater. Does he know it is wrong?"
"Yes, I'm exhausted. My daughter is teething so she hasn't been sleeping well.	I hate when that happens!  Has he gone to the doctor?"
"Seeing people taken advantage of by fake religious services is something I find the most vile. It makes them believe that they're doing the right thing, but the person taking advantage of them knows what's really up. What do you know about that?	What's really up?!?"
"Exactly, I feel that getting people to believe irrational things is the same as giving them a brain virus, it'll slowly erode their ability to think rationally.	I know it makes you feel so awful. I'm a teacher and I'm constantly checking my phone to see if there has been an intruder or someone at the door with a gun!"
"I have a presentation for work on Monday, I'm a little nervous.	I'm sure if you just stay calm you'll do fine!"
"Kind of, but I have prepared a lot so I'm sure it'll go good! I work in the human resource department for a big company and we are trying to find new ways to retain good employes.	Thats great. I hope it goes well."
"I had to leave my key in my car for the mechanic and I was left wondering if someone might find it	Why did you leave it with the car mechanic?"
"Right, there's too many people to say that it wouldn't happen	Oh man, I hope it doesn't end up like that. Did you at least go get a locksmith to check it?"
"This week was the last one for this semester of my college courses	I see.. Do you think I will be able to pass?"
"Healthcare administration, only 6 months left! I get so antsy waiting to see the final grades, it drives me crazy	I bet! Hopefully the wait will pass quickly!"
"I got woken up by my roommate and I swear his voice is the last thing you want to hear in the middle of the night, sent the fear of God through my veins	Did he ever get into an accident?"
"I don't know, I didn't answer, pretended I was asleep	That's pretty metal"
"I almost got caught stealing, I felt pretty bad	Why almost stealing?"
"A computer keyboard from my school	What made you do that?"
"I'm 38 weeks pregnant, could have my baby any day now!	Oh wow! Congratulations! Is this the first pregnancy?  I'm sure it feels exciting to have a healthy baby, but I'm sure you nervous about the surgery!"
"Yes, a bit nervous because my first birth was hard, but I know I'm ready and have everything we need for the baby!	Congratulations! I'm sure with all that preparation you have it shouldn't be an issue."
"Christmas was the best time of year back in the day!	I agree with you there! What was the best Christmas present you got as a kid/r/t?"
"Yeah, it's like there's nothing to worry about	I agree, it's like Christmas came right when you got your hands off it."
"Some random dude walked into my room while I was laying down, couldn't have been more weird	Did he at least ask you before walking away?"
"I was like what the hell, and then he said sorry and walked out	that sounds like it would make someone very angry. did you talk to your mom to let her know?"
"Someone hit my car at walmart today and drove off!	Oh no! I'm so sorry! Was it a bad accident or did they not leave any information?"
"No, I didn't see it someone reported it to customer service and they paged me. I wish they would have left a note! People have so decency sometimes!	That is so awful and frustrating! Walmart is the worst for that, so many scammers there!"
"I saw my favourite candy at the store today! Was so excited, hadn't seen it in a while.	I have never seen it before! What kind was it"
"This sour s'ghetti candy by HARIBRO. I use to eat this all the time as a child.	That sounds so good! What's it like now, with HARibros around?"
"My daughter has been sick for months but she is finally starting to get better!	That's good. Is she feeling better at home?"
"Thank you, Defenitly! She is still young and most likely won't remember this either!	That's good to hear! I hope it stays like this!"

"He had created one giant hole and filled it up with water, super cool	That sounds so fun!"
"I had to cancel our family vacation coming up next month.	Are you really upset about that?"
"Yes, his work told him he couldn't go after they already approved the time off. Guess next month is going to be busy at his work :(	That's a bummer. What did you guys do instead?"
"Life is good, it's the gift that keeps on giving	That is a very true statement."
"Glad you think so as well!	What is the gift that keeps on giving?"
"I saw a huge cockroach outside my house today!	yikes that sounds scary"
"Not yet since it's the weekend. We live in Texas so they are common but still gross! I'm glad I haven't see any in my house.	That's disgusting! Do you know if it's a female roach?"
"I have a big test on Monday, I am so nervous.	Did you study for it?"
