"Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.	oh my god , that ' s awful , i ' m so sorry to hear that . do you have insurance to cover your family ?"
"No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.	oh , that is so sad , i am so sorry to hear that ."
"I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.	Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places	that was a long time ago ago , when my aunt was pregnant . i was an only child . i had no idea what she meant when she said she was pregnant . she said she was excited to be a father , but i had no idea . i think it was a good experience for her , i guess ."
"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?	i was walking home from the store and some guy in my neighborhood pulled out of the parking lot and sped right off . i was so disgusted by his behavior that i stopped to ask him to leave . he was drinking and driving too ."
"I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together	oh my god , i feel bad . i feel for you . i hope you have a good relationship now !"
"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world	aww that is so nice , i am so happy for you , i hope you have a long and happy life"
"I couldn't wait to go to the concert.	what concert is it ? ? ? ? i ' ll gladly wait for you !"
"The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!	that ' s so cool ! u2 is a music band right ?"
"I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors	i feel the exact same as you do , i hate to hear that ."
"she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying	i feel for the poor child ' s parents . i am so sad too because i read about a woman who was once pregnant with a boy and died when they were pregnant . they said she would never have an experience like her again ."
"yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors	so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up	oh , that is so sweet . is the baby feeling okay now ?"
"i was singing nursery songs :)	oh no . did he recover ok ? was he okay ?"
"If you happy and you know it :)	my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon	what will he be doing now ? i ' m sorry to hear about your loss ."
"thank you so much!	oh , i am so sorry to hear that . i hope he finds a new one soon as well !"
"he is an armed guard	i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods!	oh man , that sounds pretty scary ! what happened next ?"
"I do! I want to be able to protect my son	oh my goodness , i am so sorry that you live in such a dangerous area ."
"i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years	oh wow , that is really exciting . i hope you are able to see them soon ."
"I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry	that ' s so cool . . i ' m happy for you"
"I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident	that ' s not very nice . how did you handle it ?"
"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	oh my god , i hope you were able to get your friend to pay the news . i would have been furious ."
"Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.	So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer	what ! that ' s the worst , man ! i hope you can at least save money for the next one so you can buy the one you want !"
"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!	i am sorry to hear that ! maybe you can find another one soon !"
"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed	My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	what was the reason that he made a pass at you ?"
"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	what a wonderful friend . your friend ' s boyfriend seems like he ' s a good one ! he sounds like a great guy ."
"my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house	how aww that ' s wonderful ! what a wonderful experience for you ! how old is he ?"
"i totally agree with you!	yeah , kids are so cool and peaceful . i can just sit back and enjoy a good night ' s sleep ."
"hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country	that is sad ! have you tried to talk to them about it ?"
"i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	aww that ' s too bad . did you try and get out did you ?"
"I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.	that is terrible . i am so sorry that happened to you ."
"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!	some people just don ' t understand that not everybody has the same ability to do so themselves ."
"I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died	what did you do with it ? i ' m so sorry !"
"Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy	I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.	oh really ? what happened ? how did it go ? !"
"Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	i ' m sorry you had to leave her , i ' m sure she ' ll come back around ."
"Thank you! That means a lot.	One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	that must have been so hard , how old is your son now ?"
"Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	that sounds amazing ! i ' m glad you remember that moment and i know that moment will always stay with you forever !"
"Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	oh yeah , i ' ve been in many situations . it ' s really hard when payment of payment is late . i ' m not familiar with the exact situation though . do you know anyone else that has been in that situation ?"
"Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.	oh yes , that ' s exactly how it goes . i always feel so grateful for people who help me ."
"Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	what happened ? i ' m not too familiar with that , tell me more !"
"My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	what happened ? i am so sorry to hear that . that must have been very devastating . what happened ?"
"Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	thanks , i appreciate that , i hope i will always have that set of belief in myself"
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	i agree with you ! it is so easy to feel confident in yourself if you dont know the truth , but i think most people feel that way !"
"I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	what a wonderful surprise party ! what are your plans for next weekend ?"
"I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there	what a wonderful memory ! what an awesome surprise ! i bet you had a great time ."
"I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	i feel you . i ' m in the same boat , and i feel the same way . you just have to find the right group to hang out with and i think you will start to feel better . i ' m sure you will feel better too when you do ."
"Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	oh no , i ' m sorry that happened to you , it must be terrible . have you thought about talking to your friends about it ?"
"As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	haha ! yeah , sometimes i can just see my kids going through the same kind of process now . i don ' t know how they ' re going to be as a parent though , they ' re all so young . i ' m too afraid of being a parent haha"
"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	you ' re making me want to read some gitgo . that sounds great"
"The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	i have never heard of it . but i am sure you must be quite interesting . tell me more !"
"Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	oh my gosh . . . . you you have a new favorite place to eat ? i love them . i love eating out at mcdonalds and a lot of other fast food places ."
"I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	i have always wanted to visit an orphan . did you have a good time ?"
"Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	i am sure it was very happy to hear that ! i have been there before . what was the trip called ?"
"My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	oh no ! i am sorry to hear that ! hopefully it does not though !"
"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	i don ' t think she did . i ' m very lucky to have her as my father , so she helped me prepare to stay strong ."
"But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	oh , that doesn ' t make you feel better ? i hope you can still be your self , but i am sure you are still a good person !"
"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	oh no ! i know that ' s terrible , but i am so sorry you had to go through that . you could ' ve at least shared that experience with them . i know that sounds like a bit of a weird thing to say ."
"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.	i ' m so sorry , i know how it feels . i feel your pain . i have the same pain as you , i know how it feels ."
"I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	sounds like you are a great boss ! what are your thoughts on his actions ?"
"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	i am very happy to respond to you , thank you ! what does this statement means ? i ' m very much as excited as you are ! i am very happy to be you !"
"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	i ' m not quite sure what you are talking about , but i am certainly not an artist ."
"My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	how oh how exciting , how much has it grown ? does it make you feel happy ?"
"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	awww , that ' s so sweet of you . i hope she will keep you guys close"
"Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	that is awesome . what kind of training did you do ?"
"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	congratulations ! i ' m glad you worked hard and you worked so hard ! what was your longest run in a year ?"
"We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	oh man , that ' s pretty amazing ! what did you do to finish the marathon ?"
"I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	i think it is good to encourage others to do that . you must be a good friend !"
"She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	what a wonderful surprise ! i am so happy that you were able to see it that way . what does she treat you differently ?"
"I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	me me too , it ' s sad that so many people are afraid to say anything"
"How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	i agree , i think we need to take a stance against bullying , i think that is just as bad ."
"Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	oh my , i am so sorry to hear that , that must be so hard"
"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	i am so sorry to hear that . i am sure your mother feels really bad for the cat ."
"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	how how old are your kids ? did they have fun ?"
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	that is awesome ! i ' ve always wanted to visit tucson . what did you guys do there ?"
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	oh thats so sweet of him , did you have fun ?"
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	wow . i bet you were very happy for him then . how long has it been since you ' ve talked ?"
"Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	yes i like to do that . i am not a big fan of organized things"
"Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	yes i do ! i don ' t have much of an organize routine , but i have so many things i need to organize !"
"I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	i understand that , that ' s annoying too . i have a lot of friends that do that , so i know what you mean ."
"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	it ' s hard to say exactly how you ' d ensure communication since there ' s not really a set up for it but i do think we should do something about it !"
"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	oh , that sounds really difficult what happened ? was it an argument about money ?"
"I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	oh that sounds so frustrating ! i hope it didn ' t turn out like this one . what was it about ?"
"I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	oh , wow ! you must have been very happy and excited !"
"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	i ' m so happy to hear that ! it sounds like you had a wonderful adventure . did you have a wonderful time ?"
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	i feel i see that all the time . . especially when you have an amazing course in mind and you know exactly what to expect"
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	i am like that , but i am also very envious of people who can do nothing at all , it ' s not healthy"
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	oh no ! why ? did your mom have to work ?"
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	you should have told him he should get his mind off of it and get back to work . he sounds like he really needs it !"
"There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	how what ? i hope you ' re not talking about me !"
"Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	oh my , what a unique story ! thank you for this ."
"Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	yeah , it ' s a scary one , especially when you ' re young . you should be more cautious , but i ' m sure you can do that ."
"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	i totally get it . i am a lucky guy : )"
"Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	it ' s the best feeling . when they ' re just little and it ' s so nice to see them smile . it ' s nice to be a parent and remember the good times ."
"Are your kids adults now?	no , they are not adults , but they are much older . i feel like they are much bigger than they were before ."
"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	that ' s great ! i ' m sure it made you feel like you looked great !"
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	that ' s awesome . i ' m sure you ' ll do fine ! i bet you ' re a wonderful woman !"
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.	how what do you guys do for yourself ? is there anything you both can do together to help make sure that we both work hard ?"
"We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	that sounds very stressful , i hope you two will both succeed ."
"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected	how what happened ? did you expect something in return ? i am not too familiar with the name"
"Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	oh that is very cool , what did you do when you met ?"
"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	that sounds really interesting . how long have you been learning the book ?"
"We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	what a beautiful story . you must be so excited ! are you going to go swimming or hiking ?"
"I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	i am sorry you were supposed to go for brunch with your friend , did you go with your friend ?"
"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	oh , that sounds terrible ! why did you guys decide to end up not going ?"
"Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	what did you do ? did you call the police ? that is very scary !"
"Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	oh wow that is pretty scary ! did he end up hitting you or following you ?"
"Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	what happened what ? ? i ' m not sure what you ' re talking about !"
"She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	oh , my goodness . . . that is terrible . i bet you two are quite late to dinner now ."
"Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	what did you do ? did you not want to say anything ?"
"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	oh , well everyone needs to at least look on the bright side sometimes . you ' ll have fun the next time you go !"
"Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	no what happened ? ? what happened ? ! ! ? !"
"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!	oh no , sorry to hear that . i am glad you were able to make it through"
"You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...	oh no ! that is horrible ! what happened ? did you call the police ?"
"My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!	oh my . how could you guess ? that must have been so exciting for you ."
"Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!	oh wow ! that sounds like a wonderful surprise ! what a wonderful surprise ! i bet he felt happy about it !"
"I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!	he sounds like a great husband ! you ' re lucky to have such a great husband !"
"I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!	i am glad you got an interview today . how are you feeling ?"
"This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?	oh wow ! congratulations ! that must have been a huge interview ! i bet you must be proud of yourself !"
"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?	why no ? what was it about ? i ' m curious ."
"As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	that must have been a really epic story . congratulations on becoming a writer !"
"I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	oh wow . that ' s really weird . how did your friend react ?"
"I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	that ' s so terrible ! i ' m so sorry . i can ' t even imagine what it must have felt like . i wonder if your friend made a move to tell your friend or something ."
"This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	oh no ! that sounds terrible . i can ' t imagine how it must have been . what a pain ."
"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	oh my god ! i hate it when that happens ! i bet it was a pain to miss out on a good sale for a day !"
"I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	oh no , did you tell her ? did you guys have a big conversation about it ?"
"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	oh no . i hope she wasn ' t being dismayed . i can understand how you feel"
"I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	you ' re pretty lucky you didn ' t break up with her , it ' s too bad ."
"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching	oh dear , well you know what they say about not having an mom that can help you forget the past !"
"THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!	I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!	i wish you luck in that , i hope you have a good time"
"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.	that sounds really exciting ! ! ! ! i ' ve i hope you have a great time . i ' m excited for you !"
"I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	that is such a wonderful accomplishment . i am glad for her !"
"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))	i do ! it ' s so amazing when you hear stories like that . it ' s a great story !"
"Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	oh my god , that ' s not something that i ' m a fan of either . i always feel bad when people do that , especially when they ' re not even putting i grocery shopping ."
"Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	i am not sure if its why they do that , but i would hate i see that too"
"WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)	I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!	oh my gosh . that ' s so exciting ! i have been married almost two years now and i still haven ' t gotten a picture . i ' m so happy for you ."

"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	that sounds like a great job . i haven ' t heard of it before , but it sounds like it ' s very interesting . i don ' t actually do any work on it , but i have a lot of reading to do ."
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	i agree , it is very inspiring . i love having someone that can help me when i ' m stressed ."
"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	i agree , it is so true . it is a trap all the way down !"
"I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	what a special moment in a child ' s life . what a lovely memory ."

"That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.	yeah i got some feedback , but i ' ve been late before so it wasn ' t really worth it . i will learn to be better at it next time ."
"So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.	wow , congrats ! is she excited about the baby ?"
"I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	wow , that is a great surprise ! nine months is a long time to wait !"
"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	no i did not . i had to go pick someone up ."
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	oh ! i don ' t have netflix . i ' ll have to find a good provider to watch it on . netflix is a bit scary netflix , i think . i can ' t watch anything over the weekend . i ' ll just stay home and wait for the next one ."
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	i ' ve you have a lot of shows on my to watch , i ' ll definitely have to check it out , i love those shows"
"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	oh , i ' m so happy you got to go through all that . you must have been really confident and prepared to get through it !"
"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.	oh wow ! that ' s awesome . how did they get you ?"
"Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job	Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!	i know how frustrating that can be . did you get out of work ?"
"Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes	i hate it when that happens . it ' s the worst ! how frustrating ! did you get out of there ?"
"The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.	oh no , did you end up giving the movie a chance ?"
"And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.	i don ' t know what that is . i ' m not really a book nerd ."
"My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.	how exciting for her . she must have been proud . you are a good friend ."
"She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.	oh that ' s awesome ! you are quite lucky ! how do you feel about that ?"

"I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too.	I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out	oh , how cute ! that is so cute ! i love that word ! how cute is the puppy going to be ?"
"Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!	wow ! congratulations ! that ' s so exciting ! what type of puppy do you have ?"
"When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them	oh , wow , that was really nice of them to help you out with your debt ! i am sure you are so grateful for them ."
"Yes, I am always better off with them as my parents, they want to see us succeed	that is very nice . parents that help with bills are great ."
"Yes, it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.	nice , i am sure they appreciate that ' s a lot of hard work . it ' s great to have your parents supporting you as well ."
"Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married	how oh congratulations ! i am sure you will be an important player when you finish ."
"My friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary. He easily makes 200,000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him.	yeah , i can understand how you feel . it ' s hard to compare income to skill , but i know a few surgeon who make more than me , at the same salary ."
"Yeah, that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance, and is on call a lot.	oh , well you guys can ' t both be on call for the same amount of time and make it together , can you ? it will take a lot of time and effort , and i think it will take you a lot of time and effort . but if you can ' t do it all at once , then i ' m sure you ' ll have to do it slowly and carefully , to make up the progress . but if you ' re both comfortable enough in your work that you can work it"
"True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.	I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future	that sounds interesting , how did it go ? did you talk to your adviser about it ?"

"That is disgusting! What can you do about about it?	nothing . i will not do anything about it . he is such a scumbag"
"You could chat to them and complain!	i don ' t know . i feel like it is just a disgusting thing to be near them , but i can ' t really tell if they are just jerks or not . i don ' t know if there ' s any other way ."
"Who knows, I guess it depends on how reasonable they are.	One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at, my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.	oh my , that sounds exciting ! how did you feel when you were kicked out ?"
"I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.	oh wow , i am so sorry you were kicked out ! did you guys get to make it through the first year with your best friend ?"
"She also has 2 daughters, 2 and 7, and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.	what are you going to do with all the crested gecko ' s ?"

"Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.	I hate bullies. Playground or politics, I find them intolerable.	me too . some of them are so annoying and it ' s just not worth it ."
"Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?	yeah we just went back to the school and talked about politics . but yeah , i felt like that was pretty bad . i felt like it was time to change the terms"
"I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.	what is a bit of it ? i am not sure what to know ."
"Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.	where i am not actually familiar with this movie . what was it about ? do you know ?"

"They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.	oh no ! that ' s terrible ! i ' m sorry you have to deal with that !"
"So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a ""mommy"" will come along to clean up after them?!	because they think that ' s where the good , healthy adults go to go when they are adults !"
"LOL! Okay, y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)	what ' s the show about ? my boyfriend is an ants lover , too . i love that show ."
"The hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on Christmas of 2007.	oh , i am so sorry to hear that , that must have been so devastating"
"She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up, she slipped.	oh no , i am so sorry to hear that . how was she feeling ?"
"It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it, but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.	awww , that ' s a cute name ! how old is your daughter ?"
"It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.	that ' s so sweet that you have someone so close to you that ' ll remember her by her last word ! i ' m so happy you have that person in your life !"

"We have dogs and chameleons together, so it's like we're already a little family haha	long distance is very important awile if you have to do it at one place . i hope you guys get to it before long term . i hope you both do eventually get to it , long distance is a tough thing to do ."

"I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?	i have not . i hope you get the job ! it sounds exciting though !"
"It just means you're in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company. To me, that helps it feel more like a conversation -- and it's more time efficient too!	I know I'm not a perfect parent but some just aren't good at it or don't care.	you can always learn from them and be better at it though"
"It is when it comes to all the unexpected stuff. Went to the mall today and lady was letting her toddler run all over the mall smelling like a dirty litter box. It smelled horrible.	oh , i know what you mean . i don ' t know how to parent ."

That is the reason.	oh wow . that ' s a long story . well , i hope you can explain yourself more about the situation interesting situation . i don ' t really know the context of the situation interesting to read about , so hopefully it ' s not too long after i finish reading your story . but if you ' re still a good writer , i ' m sure your english is good enough to know the story , so hopefully you will read it soon ."

"Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.	i am ashamed of myself as well for stealing but i am ashamed that i did it ."
"If that is the case, I can understand why they had to do it. In circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain, then it is most definitely wrong.	i agree . i think if you have to steal something then you should definitely do it . but i just feel like they did it out of necessity , and i am not sure they deserved it ."

"Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors!	oh no , don ' t forget about it> ! you can always start now !"
"Oh cool! What kind of doctor?	oh , i ' m not sure but you shouldn ' t tell them !"
"Oh wow, you must be very proud of her. That is quite an accomplishment.	i am so proud ! she was the first one in her major and has been in such a tough place ."

She put in a lot of effort, and she proved to herself and others that she could do it.	oh wow ! that ' s awesome . yes i am . i am very proud of her . i also know that she ' s worked very hard and is finally getting her degree . i can ' t wait to see what else she can do with it !"

"A violent windstorm blew through my town and uprooted a tree in my yard.	that sounds terrifying ! i am so sorry that it happened . do you think you will be ok ?"
"No, it missed everything but the lawn. And then my neighbor was nice enough to bring over his chainsaw and help me cut it up for disposal.	oh wow , that ' s awful ! was the tree fine though ?"
"I used to know someone who got incredibly famous.	how long what did he do ? how did he do it ?"
"She's a female singer. It sort of burns me up because I feel like she doesn't deserve it and she's rather manipulative.	what did she do to deserve such a large amount of attention ?"
"Sorry, I won't do that.  But pick the female singer you dislike the most and pretend it's her.	Years ago I used to have such a good time. I had money to spend, time to do the things I love. How I long for those times again!	what kind of things did you love the most ? i loved my time back in college ."
"Didn't the sun always shine back then, when we were happy and young and had money?!	oh , i miss the good old days , i wish i could say the same !"
"That's true. I still like to look fondly upon the past, but the future will be bright, too.	Someone broke into my apartment last week. I was not home at the time, but now I worry that they will come back.	oh my gosh ! that is so scary ! did you confront the person ?"
"Yes, my TV was stolen. They also clogged every toilet in my apartment. I think they have just eaten Thai food.	oh man ! i would be really worried they are stealing . i am sorry to hear that ."

"I did, they are investigating currently. I hope they find the hoodlums.	oh wow , what a hit . how long ago was this ? i hope they ' re all back ."
"I did not get the job that I had interviewed for. I thought the interview went well, but I guess not.	do you have any other ideas as to where to go to apply ?"
"Not as of now. I have applied to a couple of other jobs.	i am sure it will come in soon and i am sure you will get something in return . just keep trying and i am sure it will come in soon !"

"I couldn't buy my brother his gift from an online retailer that starts with an A, because apparently they don't ship to Canada from their .com website. :(	oh no ! you can always buy online from other stores though ."
"Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.	wow , that ' s insane . . . that ' s crazy . you ' d think they ' d be easier to shipping things to . . ."
"she took me for $1600 in just 2 weeks. What a trap	wow ! that ' s quite the investment , you must have a lot of debt ."
"It's been 7 years and I'm still not over it	i what ? why are you not over it- what is more important , the money or the cards ?"
"Sat here by myself for 10 days straight. Car was in the shop being repaired	oh wow . how did that go ? did you end up having a good time ?"
"It did actually. Made me so mad. Now I have to save up again	wow ! i am sorry . i hope you can at least save up for another month or so before you get your money back ."
"For 8 months we were led to believe we would move in to our own place. Lies	that ' s amazing . i ' m so happy you got out of that situation . do you think you are still going to be in the house ?"
"Instead her stupid grandma moved in to it!	i feel wow , that must be really scary for her . why didn ' t you believe you would move in ?"
"At the time I didn't think it was bad. But after she told me she didn't actually like it, that made me think differently	it sounds like you ' re a really good friend . i ' m glad you found your soulmate !"
"Well she had never done it before, so I thought it was special	what a great way to end a relationship , to be honest !"
"I'm very proud of her for traveling alone at 6 months pregnant	i ' m not sure if you ' re a parent or a parent but you should be ."
"Yes. It's a boy	oh that ' s really nice . i hope she is able to keep up with her life ."
"My child got sick and I had just made arrangements to go out of town on business.	oh no ! i ' m so sorry ! i ' m so sorry ! did they have to go ?"
"I had to tell my boss I couldn't go and I was so stressed about that. It turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go.	wow , that sucks . hopefully you will be able to reschedule for next year ."
"I wish I had money. Then she'd sit with me instead of him	oh no , that ' s no good . why not just buy her one day ?"
"In the club	oh no , why does she want to sit with you ?"
"I don't feel bad. It's not like I made her do it. She wanted to	oh , ok . well i hope you don ' t feel too bad then ."
"She knew what she was doing. I don't care how old she was. She knew	oh , ok . well that makes sense . i hope she grows out of it ."
"I know I will save the money I need for the baby	oh , you must be a very good driver . what makes you confident about that ?"
"Just to keep on working as much as I can everyday	good idea , what are you going to do ? do you have a plan for the baby ?"
"I wish I never did it now. I thought it wasn't going to come out	you must be pretty confident in your abilities . do you know what you ' re going to do ?"
"Kinda. I thought it was a secret	oh no , i ' m so sorry . what happened ?"
"it was brutal	that ' s a great accomplishment ! what is your new job now ?"
"i didnt shower for a few days and had an important meeting. I could tell that they could smell me. I became a tomato.	oh my god . that ' s so funny . are you ok ?"
"yes. homeless for a bit	oh man . i hope you didn ' t get sick or something bad happen ."
"i feel really bad about cheating on my girlfriend with a mutual friend.. i cant even look her in the eye	why did you cheat ? did you not tell her ? was it an accident ?"
"it was a one time thing.. if i tell her that would break her	it ' s not about cheating . you have to have honesty and trust in a relationship ."
"i was heartbroken when my dad passed away.. still not over it.	i ' m so sorry to hear that ! losing a parent is never easy ."
"5 years..	im sorry to hear that . what was the reason ? did he pass away recently ?"
"i was proud to see my kid winning in painting competition.. she seems like a born artist	that ' s so awesome . i bet you are so proud . what kind of paintings does she make ?"

"yeah.. but its too soon i feel	that ' s too bad , i ' m so sorry . i ' m sure you ' ll have fun when you feel content with it though ."

"I fell down at work, and my khaki pants ripped open.	that is so embarrassing ! how did you feel about it ?"

"My grandpa is coming to visit!,5|5|5_5|5|5,	that is really exciting for you ! i bet he will enjoy grandpa will be happy to see you !"
"He is coming next week! We are going to play Bingo at the local American Legion every night!	i am really happy for you . how old is your grandpa ?"
"I ate a gas station burrito for lunch. It was not very appetizing. Actually, it was absolutely horrible.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	oh gosh , i hope you didn ' t have any more nightmares ."
"Yes, and now my tummy has the rumblies. My workplace bathroom is a one-seater right next to my work crush's desk. I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.	oh my goodness , you have a stomach flu , i hope you feel better soon !"
"how was your day?	it was pretty cool . i had so much fun . what about you ?"

"oh how was the climate there/	it was fine . . . it is the same as it has been for all of history ."
"I managed to accidently flash a dozen people	what did you do ? did you do it on purpose or did you just do it to show your self ?"
"it was windy and the wind caught my shirt.  I was like ""oops!	oh man that sounds so terrible ! what did you do ?"
"Yes.  Luckily people around me thought it was amusing and not offensive	i have always more trust on my girlfriend	that ' s great that you have that trust . what do you plan to do ?"
"yeah i do. i love her a lot	what exactly is that ? what is her name ? ! !"
"what about you?	I have a big exam coming up! My nerves are getting to me.	oh , what are you going to study for ? i hope you do well on it"

"They have sloths, hippos, elephants, bears!	that sounds so cool ! i wish i could go to the zoo"
"I had a guest over that used my restroom, and they obviously have some sort of digestive issue! They didn't event tell me about it!	oh my goodness ! what an awkward situation that must have been . did you go back to their restroom ?"
"Yes it is. Do you think I should confront them?	i think so ! i think they probably need some professional help ."
"i have been more happy	that is a good way to start . do you have a plan to come back from it ?"
"happier now beacuse i have been built a new house	that is wonderful to hear ! i ' m sure you will be a great father and will be very proud of you ."
"Back to school time is always stressful because of how much everything costs now.	i know right , i know what you mean ! how much does that cost nowadays ?"

"i have been more happy that i have bought a car	oh wow that is great , what kind ? and how much will it cost ?"
"audi q7	i don ' t know about that , but that ' s still nice ."
"My wife bought me a new watch for my birthday! She is such a sweetheart.	oh wow ! how sweet of her ! what brand ? and where is she going you got it from ?"
"She is! It was a watch that I had been wanting for a long time. I have used the same G-Shock watch for 6 years (which I love), but I wanted the upgraded version.	congratulation ! that sounds like a wonderful surprise and gift . what did she get you ?"
"I just graduated from college! I feel so accomplished.	congratulations ! what degree did you get ? i am so excited for you ! what did you go to college for ?"
"I am very excited about it! Although I am a bit nervous about what is to come. I still need to find a job.	i know the feeling . i hope it goes well ! i know how you feel though , it is tough !"

"I have, too. I actually took two classes this summer. I took an online final exam about an hour ago, and I scored the grade that I was needing. The grade I am concerned about is a Strategic Management course that I also was taking. The professor was a bit of a stickler when it came to grading.	ah , well hopefully you get an a ! that ' s pretty tough , and if you ' re good at reading old books , you ' re bound to get an a . i ' m sure you ' ll do just fine !"
"I recently had intercourse with somebody that I hate. I feel terrible.	oh no , what happened ? what happened ? what happened ?"
"No, I do not think I should. This person doesn't make me happy.	i am sorry to hear that , what happened ? did you call them ?"
"My mom got really sick for a long time before she died. I was doing my best to see are as often as I could but I had work and lived 6 hours away.	oh no , i ' m so sorry to hear that . i know it ' s hard when you miss family ."
"The worst thing happened though. I wasn't able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off	that is such a terrible thing to have to go through . did you get to see her ?"
"I recently went to eat a restaurant that was not very clean. The whole place had an odd odor and made me uncomfortable.	did you ask them to clean it up ? don ' t you have to wash your hands after eating ?"
"I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning.	i hope your day is going well and you can keep going . what will you do ?"
"I recently returned to my childhood home, and it brought back a flood of wonderful memories. I am feeling quite sentimental.	that is amazing ! where did you go to your childhood home ?"
"Yes, it definitely can be an emotional experience. Were/are you close with your grandparents?	i am close with them a touch , but not quite quite as much as my grandparents . they live far away now , but i ' m still in touch with them ."
"I was going through some boxes the other day. I found some old pictures of my kids I thought were gone	oh wow . you must be excited . . . have you been looking for them since ?"
"Yes, definitely! It really made us all start talking about those and other memories, good times.	i remember when i found my old pictures i had been looking through my parents ' attic . it felt like a time when everything was right in the world ."
"We had to get out of the house because of Hurricane Matthew. It was a scary experience, but luckily we'd already packed what we needed into the car, so could just leave.	i oh , my condolences , i know it was a scary thing ! we got out oh well . i live in florida and was trapped for a couple days when it happened . it ' s good that you were prepared !"
"Oh, you poor thing! Thankfully, we'd gassed up and were good to go. The house survived too. Were you ok?	i ' m good , i was fine ! i live in miami and we had a lot of flooding but we evacuated safely . i am glad to hear you went through with it . it ' s such a scary thing to be in a place where there was no power for a while but then it turned out great ."
"Ugh. We had to take the walls back to the studs, it was so bad inside. But thankfully we have wonderful friends, who accommodated us and helped with the clean-up!	I recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous.	oh yeah ? what happened ? what did you have to do ?"
"It started off as a checkup, but then they requested additional testing.	oh wow ! sounds like something bad happened ! did you get a checkup ?"
"My neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! I couldn't believe how fast they completed the project!	what do you think they are going to do do for the treehouse ?"
"Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse?	yes , i have . i did not . it was pretty scary , honestly ."
"I recently had to attend a funeral. That's never a fun day.	what was the event ? did you have to attend ? did you have fun ?"
"Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother.	oh i ' m sorry to hear that , i hope you can visit her again soon ."
"I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me	oh man ! what happened next ? did you end up being able to do anything you wanted to ?"
"I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing	what doctor are you talking about ? that must be frustrating for you because you ' re always wait so long . what did you do about it ?"
"Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!	i hope they didn ' t take advantage of you . . ."
"I am waiting to take a big test coming up! I feel prepared, yet I am anxious.	i ' m sure you ' ll do fine if you ' ve been studying !"
"Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking.	oh that ' s so exciting ! i am sure you will do great on it ! you must be a hard student ! do you have a hard time preparing for it ?"
"I am taking a vacation to Orange Beach, Alabama in a week! My wife and I visited the area about two years ago, and we loved it!	that is so awesome ! orange beach is beautiful ! ! are you going to see the ocean ?"
"We can't wait! Have you ever been to the ocean?	i have actually . i have seen orange beach beach and had a few times to go to the beach !"
"One time my husband surprised me on our anniversary with a really pretty necklace and a trip to a Bed and Breakfast!	that ' s really sweet . i bet you guys have had such a fun time together !"
"We have been married for 14 years.  Another reason it was so surprising was b/c he usually just takes me to dinner!	oh , that is so sweet oh wow . i love that ! that necklace sounds like a special necklace ! so nice and nice to have that type of surprise ! i wish i had a necklace like that"
"It was one of those keys to your heart type.  Do you know what I mean?	14 years . . . that ' s a long time . i guess 14 years is a long time , but you must have been together for a long time ."
"Yes the ones from Kay Jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top	oh that sounds so cool ! i bet you are really excited to talk to the person that gave it to you ."
"I went to the store for sodas and it ended up being a rough trip.	what happened ? what happened ? ! ! ? ! ? !"
"I dropped my money while my hands were full, ran into the door, and the bag busted sending a 2 liter bouncing through the parking lot. And of course there were a lot of people that saw.	oh man , that sounds so scary . you must have been super excited to see such a big group of people coming to you !"
"I suspect that my husband is fixing a lot to go to a party, I suspect he is going to see someone	that ' s cool , does he have a good plan for it ?"
"I'm going to take some time and I'll be looking at it with caution	what are you going to do have for the party ? do you know where you will be staying ?"
"sure ... thanks	My sister is always the sibling that my parents talk about. Sometimes I wonder if they even notice me.	oh my gosh , how old is your sister ? how old are you ?"
"I haven't. I'm scared that it would just make the situation worse. Do you think I should tell them how I feel?	you should try to talk to them about it . if it will help them realize it is a big deal to you , then i think that might be a good idea"
"My boss finally realized all the hard work I've been doing lately.	how you must be excited to have someone come over and help you on your work , how is that going ?"
"Things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately, but mine finally came through at a good time!	oh wow , that ' s great ! i bet that is very exciting ."
"Thanks. And it's the weekend. Perfect timing.	I was on an airplane last week, and someone's baby would not stop crying. I know it isn't right to be upset about such things, but it really bothered me.	oh my gosh , i would be upset too ! how old is the baby ?"
"I tried to think about that, but I was still aggravated. On the plus side, at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational.	oh that is so sweet of you to be able to have that kind of compassion for people ."
"I was given a job offer at a new company. I decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty.	why would you do that ? loyalty is not always a good thing ."
"Yes, I think so as well. The new company offered me approximately $10,000 more a year than my current business is paying though.	congratulations , i hope you will do well at your new company then !"
"My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady.	that is very kind of her . i ' m sure you will have a great time talking to her ."
"I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card, but she is living on a fixed income.	i know how you feel . i ' m very fortunate to have a grandparent that i can still talk to , but i ' m not one of the lucky ones in the family ."
"A tornado blew through my town last week. My family hid in our storm shelter, but I wasn't sure if we were going to survive it unscathed.	wow ! how scary ! we had a tornado here and it was horrible . was you house safe ?"
"Thank you! We were rather frightened, and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended.	wow , that sounds like a scary experience ! tornadoes are quite the force of nature , and i ' m glad you were ready ! was your house okay ?"
"Hello the plants in my garden I water them, I move the earth, I try to keep them happy	that is awesome ! i love gardening too ! what kind of plants are they ?"
"Especially when you feel something special by nature	that ' s great , i wish i had your garden . i bet you make some beautiful money !"
"I hope this feeling increases	My wife has a big birthday coming up and I've got a great weekend all laid out for her.	that how exciting ! what is she planning on doing ? i ' m sure it will be a good day !"
"We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years.	what a beautiful and thoughtful and exciting surprise . you are so lucky !"
"Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows, but I can't really tell for sure.	oh man . . . i hope it turns out for the best !"
"Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!	oh , you were really nice . did you get him some ice cream ?"
"Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.	i think you should have kept it secret to yourself , especially if he knew you lied ."
"Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.	i have never been this excited for this day in my life . what was done ?"
"Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'	i ' m so sorry . i think i ' m a bit lost . . . i ' m not sure what ' s going on"
"I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom, ever!	oh wow , that ' s pretty annoying . what did you do ?"
"I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!	that is so funny , i have heard that too , when i was young i once went to a gas station that looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom . i felt bad but didn ' t want to go because i had to walk home to a restroom ."
"I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding!	oh man , i ' m sorry . stealing is not the same as stealing . stealing can be a very tough thing to do . but , i feel you on the guilty part . i have done it before , and stealing before . i feel guilty sometimes too . but stealing is one of those things that i can ' t help but feel bad about , and i just want to make sure you feel bad about it . i hope you can resolve that guilt somehow ."
"Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?	give it to your family . steal it or buy it ."
"it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.	that ' s very annoying and not a good way to start a relationship ."
"Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.	i totally understand . i love going to the best restaurant i can afford but i hate when someone tells me to do it !"
"I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic.	what did you do on your weekend ? do tell ! what did you do ?"
"it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup.	that ' s so nice , did you guys get to talk ?"
"I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.	congratulations ! that ' s awesome ! you must be very proud of yourself and excited to have accomplished that ."
"Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!	wow that ' s awesome . that is a pretty crazy teacher . he must be pretty crazy !"
"Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been.	that is a wonderful thing , i am glad you are happy for that ."
"Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!	how i what are your plans ? that ' s a good way to think of it ."
"My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness	i thank god for that too . i need friends like that ."
"I wish they did not suffer, because it is my suffering	how do do they scold you when necessary ? that is very kind of them !"
"Thanks for your comprehension	Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window.	oh wow ! that must have been frightening ! do you still have any family that lives in the area ?"
"By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.	oh wow . i hope you did not have to stay in that long . sounds like it was a scary experience . i can imagine how you felt ."
"I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.	i am so sorry that you have that . you should not give up on your life because of this . i ' m sure your friends will understand ."
"No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed	i am so sorry you have that . i am very glad you can get through this ."
"no it is an autoimmune disease	Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken	i am so sorry to hear that , you must feel very lonely and alone ."
"one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel	oh , i am so sorry that you are desolate . i am sure you will be fine , though . just stay strong !"
"is that he loved her	This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from.	oh that is really terrible ! is there something wrong with the smell ?"
"Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky.	oh man , that sounds so gross ! i ' m sorry you had to experience that !"
"I recently went on a trip with a woman I adore. The trip ended poorly, though, and things have not been the same since.	oh , that is no fun , i ' m sorry to hear that ! did you try to go with her again ?"
"We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.	did the trip ended okay ? i am sorry to hear that . how did things end ?"
"If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!	i think it ' s because she doesn ' t want to be up all morning by 3am . i ' m sorry , that must be frustrating ."
"You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.	i usually just tell them to get to bed before 6am and go to bed then . i don ' t know , it ' s hard for me to be organized . my apartment is big , so it ' s pretty easy to get into trouble ."
"Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.	you yell at them until they shut up , but you don ' t have to yell ."
"I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!	yeah , definitely not my place to be either . i think if you ' re not going to give in , you might as well move somewhere else ."
"I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!	i have always heard that the suspense is quite strong for that , it would probably work fine . i am sure you will have an operation done soon ."

"I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.	what did they do that to betray your trust ? did you ask for it back ?"

"Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.	you ' re right that ' s not something you can expect from an airbnb partner ! but it sounds like you guys were hanging out anyway , so you should be happy you two had a good time ."

But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year, I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!	oh gosh , it sounds like you ' re starting to be a bit stressed , so i ' m glad i ' m not the only one ! it can get a little nerveycoplex ."

"So I want to buy a new vehicle but I'm nervous about pulling the trigger on it.	do you have any other interest in driving ? do you feel you are prepared ?"

"Oh yes. I wish I could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them, but I would be lying.	i would be very upset about it if i had to do it again , but i am sure the poop is really gross to deal with !"
"So I was listening to rap in my car with the windows down. The people in the car next to me were just staring at me. It was kinda awkward.	oh man ! i bet you were nervous , did you say anything to them ?"
"Yeah, not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.	haha . . . that must ' ve been awkward . . i don ' t blame them ! ! ! i don ' t have a car but i would be tinted hahahahah"

"It is. I've been trying to switch apartments for months and this is the first time someone has actually done anything about it.	wow , how amazing . i am very impressed that someone can be so efficient at what they do ."
"Absolutely! I move September 1st. No more stompy screechy neighbors at 3 am!!	School for my kids started again this past Thursday.	oh no ! are you ready ? what do they want to do ?"

"Not really. I live in town, but it's a small town.	what are you talking about ? that ' s so annoying . it ' s been there for so long . it ' s a shame you lost it ."
"That's a good idea. I might do that. We don't have a camera because we don't normally have any troubles.	you could always take a video and send it to the police . or maybe a friend that knows the guy and can help you out ."

"At first I tried to resist, but I ended up adopting him!	oh my goodness . you ' re so brave . what type of tabby was he ?"
"I received a wrong number call last night at 2 in the morning.	oh , did you have to call again ? did you call back ?"

"I am highly upset that I'm the only one concerned with earning money for our bills	why do you think that is ? do you have any idea what you are looking to do ?"

"I called the cops! Turns out that it's bird bones! My cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden!	oh my , that ' s awful ! are you going to get it oh boy . . ."
"I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals!	oh yes , i feel that too . i don ' t know what ' s wrong with them . i don ' t think they deserve the support they get ."
"They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!	i feel i feel like you would have to have an emotive court date to get them out of the hospital for a few years , but yes it is a sad thing to hear stories like that are happening now"
"More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.	Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I.	what ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? i ' m so intrigued"
"It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in.	what ? ! i am so sorry . that must have scared you so much ! did you investigate it more ?"
"It would be, I worry for the safety of my family.	My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.	that would be very nice , how long has it been ?"
"They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.	good to hear he was able to repay you . do you know where he went in the bind ?"
"Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.	My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first	oh , that is so scary . did you fall asleep in the car ?"
"He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too!	good for him . it was a good thing you two were prepared ! you must be very glad it was turned out safe ."
"Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.	i ' ve seen a few flies at night . those things are very creepy ."
"Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?	oh , wow ! those sound so scary ! i ' ve seen them in the daytime too . i bet there must be something very weird about it ."
"i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes	i ' ve always had that problem with pretty much every one of my friends , but i think it ' s good that your friend is so nice to be around ."

"It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.	i ' m so sorry to hear i know what you mean . how long ago was it that he passed ?"
"Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.	oh no ! how long ago was he passed away ? that ' s so sad to hear , but it sounds like you and your pet had a great bond . i ' m so sorry ."
"A border collie, he was a great doggie.	My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.	oh no , i hope they can get it checked out ."
"She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.	that ' s awesome that you had such a patient daughter who could able to help you . do you have family that lives across the country from you ?"
"I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.	are you going to be ok ? i hope you have insurance ."
"I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay, but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.	oh man , you ' re a really big person , man . i hope you feel better soon !"
"I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.	what kind of kit do you have so that it will be ok ?"
"I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.	that ' s awesome ! where do you live ? i ' m in florida , so we don ' t really have snow days , but i ' m sure it would have been scary !"
"I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!	I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.	what is your degree in ? i have never heard of it ."

"I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.	oh wow . i hope you ' ll be okay . are you nervous ?"
"Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.	i ' m sorry to hear that , are you going to reschedule your trip ?"
"In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.	i totally agree , its the worst , especially if it is a family member ."
"Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.	oh , i ' m sorry to hear that . what happened ?"
"Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.	A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.	wow , how do you feel about that ? how are you doing on your cruise ?"
"Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!	how long did you have to wait before you could go on it ?"
"When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped.	oh my gosh , i feel sorry for her . what a hard thing to go through . i ' m sure she has a bright future ahead of her ."

"Not really I  almost had an accident at some of the startling points.	how did you do that ? did you cry ? i would have been so scared !"
"I have been looking around at different car insurance quotes	are you looking for a specific insurance plan ? or just something that helps cover specific things ?"
"a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is	oh yea , that must be interesting to look at ! i ' m in the same boat as you . what do you think is going to happen now ?"
"I just ate a whole cake by myself, I feel sick!	what kind of cake was it ? ? did you have a cake ?"
"Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house.	what kind of cake did you have ? and yea , you shouldn ' t drink any more too much than you can eat"
"The other night I had a panic attack out the blue	what happened ? i ' m afraid to ask . are you ok ?"
"Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about.	oh man , i hope you ' re ok ! that is a lot to be stressed about !"
"I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.	i hope your dog is ok , it was a nice thing to do ."
"We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.	oh no ! did you lock your door ? that ' s good and all , but i ' m sure you ' ve got a chip on your shoulder ."
"We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there.	I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing.	i ' m sorry to hear i can relate to that , i ' m sorry to hear that . i ' m sorry to hear that ."
"That's just it. We didn't really ""break up"" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.	oh , man , that ' s rough ! hopefully you ' ll find somebody better . do you feel like you ' re holding back the memories ?"
"Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight.	how that was nice , i hope you can still afford a good drink !"

"It is, I have been so blessed in my life!	My husband started college this week!	that ' s awesome ! how long have you been together ?"

"Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid, I was really frightened the other night.	what movie did you watch ? i can relate to that to how you feel"
"I went for a drink downstairs, and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night,lol.	oh no , that sounds really scary . did you find out what happened next ?"
"I really was, and I'm supposed to be the grown up, but I got my daughter to lie next to me.	My neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep!	what are they barking at ? are they being loud ? ? ?"
"People walking on the bike trail behind our house. It's a daily thing, it gets so annoying!	that ' s terrible , that ' s annoying . maybe you should complain to the police ."
"I just got done eating an entire pizza by myself.	i bet you had a good time , did you have your hands on the pizza ?"
"I feel so full and fat and happy. I can't wait to do it again.	how many that sounds great , what kind of pizza ? pizza hut is my favorite place to get and my friend has been having some ."

"It really is, you are molding their future!	I just lost my dog. My ex got him in the divorce	oh no ! i am so sorry ! what breed is he ?"
"No we are not on speaking terms, It's pretty unfair, thankfully we didn't have a kid together.	that ' s quite a situation , how did he end up in the divorce ?"
"Getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle.	oh yeah , i know how that goes . i ' m still trying to learn the new card and what to do with money ."
"They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.	that sucks ! i hate it when that happens ! have you tried getting a new card and putting it in the bank ?"
"It is, to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.	My sister got a promotion at work last week!	what type of job is it ? i ' m hoping to get a promotion too !"

"Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?	oh no ! i am sorry , i know you are trying to be helpful but i am sure you already knew what you were getting into ."
"Cant wait to see what he can do,  Its exciting too!	that ' s definitely exciting . i bet you ' re really excited . i ' m sure he ' ll do fine . i hope he enjoys it !"

"It sure is now, but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.	oh i remember the excitement that went along with the 64 . i also remember playing mario kart 8 on it . it is my favorite game of all time"

"Let me tell you something. Always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters. Few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!	oh my gosh i just saw that too . i ' m sorry . i can ' t even look at my phone to check for them ."
"Not only did I have a rough morning because of it, but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.	i ' m sorry to hear that , but i don ' t really know what to say . i guess i ' m sorry that you were so disappointed in yourself . do you write any books ?"
"4	what i wish i can do that , i am a pretty amazing person"
"Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon, they carry something in their nails/claws.	oh wow . . . that is a long time ago . is it still in its claws ?"
"My son wanted one of those once, but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one,lol.	I got canned from my job and I'm feeling pretty good these days because I have more work than I can handle without needing to go to an office everyday	that what i ' m saying . i know how that goes . it ' s not for everyone ."
"Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts, good thing I'm not allergic	you should be fine until you start working , you deserve it : )"
"I was laying in bed last night when I realized just how happy I am	what did you do ? how did you realize ? i ' m not familiar with this term ."

"No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it, my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!	oh man , that ' s annoying . . . . why can ' t people just be honest ! !"
"I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.	oh my gosh , how frustrating ! i ' m sorry , i hope you can talk to your roommate about it and tell him how it ' s bothering you ."
"She probably did, during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am, drunk, with some random guy she brought home from the club.	oh well , i ' m glad you took responsibility and took the responsible action !"
"Either he ate it, or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it, and I'm about to hulk out!	I am so not ready for this baby. The wife is due next week, and I'm really uncertain that I'm gonna be a good dad or that we'll have enough to provide for her.	oh wow , well if its any im sure you can do it !"
"I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books, and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.	what kind of baby is she having ? and what are her weaknesses ?"
"I was walking and say a cat in front of me wagging its tail on the sidewalk and thought it was awesome	how what ? ! ! what was it ? ! ? !"
"I attacked it with some pets, it was an outside cat which don't get angry too much I'm guessing	i don ' t get angry with cats . they can be very sly and unfaithful when it comes to their owners"

"I was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex-girlfriend didn't get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before I moved. Really made me miss her, seeing all that stuff.	wow ! what a horrible thing to see . . . i hate i think i would have been a little jealous"
"Well, I spent some time remembering the good times. Then I reminded myself that we broke up for a reason, and we'd moved on. Had to process all the way through it, you know?	i know how that feels , i ' ve been there . i know how that feels . i know it ' s really hard to be in a long distance relationship , especially when you are moving . i ' m so sorry . i hope everything is better now for you !"
"Polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call.	absolutely i agree , its not just about safety though , its about being prepared to drive i believe ."
"I threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!	oh no , you must have been mortified ! what did you do ?"
"I understand, but coming at me head on, on a two lane highway, while I'm on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool.	oh yea that does sound dangerous . . dont take it the way that it is though . you should stay safe just in case !"
"Uh oh, did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.	oh , ok . you should go ask the police about it"
"2	I saw a scorpion in my house yesterday and still haven't found it!	i how far i ' m afraid you will . i believe you . do you know how to use it ?"

"Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young, so she has a way to go, but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.	what kind of art do you like to do ? like do you do it for money or for fun ?"
"I used to worry that I would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if I had problems, but my best friend Kayla has proved otherwise.	i ' m glad that you have good friends . i hope you have a good support system in place for handling problems ."
"I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life, and she's always been supportive.	oh , that is really cool . it sounds like you have a really good support system . you sound very fortunate ."
"I have some bad news, unfortunately. Well, bad for me. I was diagnosed with lung cancer.	oh no . . i am so sorry to hear that . it must have been a terrible thing ."
"It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health, and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.	oh wow , that is terrible . i ' m so sorry to hear that . i hope it ' s all well and good for you ."
"Thank you so much for being supportive. :)	I heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night. I think it was 2 or 3 in the morning.	that would be so scary ! did you stay up what you were hearing ?"
"Not a chance! I was too scared to go out, and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.	oh no ! did you get in trouble for the shooter ?"
"Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that, no way jose.	I really didn't know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend.	how long i hope he will be okay . is he alright ?"
"Seems to have, yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year, but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.	oh , i ' m so sorry to hear that . how long i hope it all turns out for him ."
"Yes, hopefully he does, because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely, not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.	I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...	oh my god , that is so awful . im so sorry !"
"I might look into that, thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore, it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids, is a big one.	you ' re welcome . i hope everything goes well . i ' ve heard that it ' s really hard to know how you are going to cope with the news . i have a friend who has the same problem and i can tell you that the medical field is getting better and better . you can do your best and i know you will be fine ."
"Playing old video games reminds of the summers where my friends and I would hang out endlessly	oh i remember those days . what games did you play ?"

"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing and all, but it was supposed to be MY discovery. I wanted that Nobel Prize and the trip to Stockholm. Now I don't think my dad will ever think I've accomplished anything.	well , maybe you should start trying to be more excited about the next thing ."
"I went to a movie alone recently because none of my friends wanted to go with me	did you go alone because your friends didn ' t want to go with you ?"
"Jurassic World. It was okay.	that ' s unfortunate that no one wanted to go with you . maybe you can try again ?"
"I just bought iced coffee yesterday and my brother drank the rest of it without asking me.	what an odd situation what happened to him . i hope you guys have a nice conversation"
"Yeah, he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge.	oh , that is pretty sweet of him . how old is he ?"
"I thought it was unfair how YouTube banned Alex Jones	why did they do that ? is he famous ? i don ' t know him and i ' m curious ."
"I think people are just getting riled up for the midterms	i think so too . i mean , it ' s good to have someone you can talk to about your business but at the end of the day he is a famous person and he should be treated with the same respect as any other person that is on the network ."
"I was playing hide n seek when I was a kid and I had to use the restroom, but then I realized after a couple minutes that there was someone behind the shower curtain	that ' s a pretty scary thing to think about ! did you find out who ?"

"My girlfriend has been cheating on me with another woman!	oh my god , that must really suck . why do you think it ' s going to end well ?"
"Yeah, tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men, but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!	what are you going to do i can ' t even begin to understand how can you not get over this ? betrayal is such a horrible thing to deal with . how are you still with her ?"
"Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl, and I was stupid enough to believe her.	I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty. Family always comes first.	i see , that is very interesting . you must have done a great job of supporting him ."
"I helped him pack the essentials in his wood-paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him. It was the least I could do.	that was very nice of you . what do you think he will do now ?"
"Speaking of kids in school, I just found out my son got a B in his world history class at the end of the previous school year. I can't believe it.	wow ! that ' s awesome ! did he study for it ?"
"No no, see, it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average, I guess. :(	what is your son doing now ? you are so lucky ! b ' s are awesome"
"He seemed fine about it, which is weird because he's always been so proud to bring home straight As. I'm really hoping he does turn it around next year. I also hope he's not on drugs or something. I suppose we'll see.	So I have some amazing news. I recently discovered that my dog can speak to me! Isn't that incredible?	that ' s pretty cool . i have never heard of dog speak to me . what is it saying ?"

If not, my food could be ""gluten free"" but cross contaminated with foods that aren't and still make me ill.	wow that is a bold what if , what are they gonna what ?"
"If it's mild, just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say, eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten, my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!	i am glad to know that i am not the only one having issues with gluten"
"Inflammation is the devil.  I'm just glad I found out how to manage it to improve my quality of life.	We ordered 3 diet cokes with dinner the other night, and they all came out a different shade of coloring!	wow , i am sure they are quite disappointed in you . did you tell them why ?"

"I told my brother that I was planning to propose to my best friend, but I hope he keeps it a secret!	that is a good idea ! it would be nice for him to keep it a secret ."
"He lets things slip once in a while, but this is a pretty big secret so I have confidence in him.	oh my , congratulations to you for showing your trust to him ! that ' s very exciting ! have you two ever been friends ?"

"Yes, I prayed about it multiple times, and by the last night, I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too. It felt amazing and it carried over into both services on Sunday too.	that is great . i do not think anyone could have ever said that without feeling sad"

"No. We've had a group text going for several years so we just all decided it had been too long.	oh that ' s understandable . well , good on you guys for being responsible enough to keep it going !"
"My wife bought some new clothes and in classic fashion she lied about how much she actually spent.	oh no , did she give how much she spent ? how did you handle it ?"
"I know I know. I just wish she could tell me up front. I get more irritated finding out she lied about it.	that ' s so annoying . . . i would be upset too ! what did she say to make it up up ?"

"My husband's grandfather recently passed away, and his three sons are acting very childish and selfish about everything concerning the will.	oh no , what do you think they ' re doing to childish ?"
"It really is. The worst part is that they had arguments in front of him, while he was sick, about who should get what. I wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him. That's what my husband and I tried to do.	i understand , it ' s really tough when families can go through that , especially when it ' s kids ! it makes you really wonder what they think is right or left to the will"

"Last week, they arrested 9 people for animal cruelty at a nearby farm and the place was littered with dead and sick and dying animals that they weren't taking care of.	that ' s a shame . i ' m glad they were arrested though !"
"I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man, but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!	i hope they get released someday too . what is your opinion of the person who arrested 9 people ?"
"Where I live, they're only now starting to toughen up the animal cruelty laws.  Even so, they lag far behind a lot of other states.	When the England national team made the semi-finals of the World Cup	oh , i must have been very happy about that . what a fantastic game !"

"Yes indeed, there was even a frog under there! So bizarre!	oh man , that must be a really big frog under there ! that must be very strange . i don ' t like frog ."
"They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!	oh man , you should get them off as soon as possible that you can . they deserve to be in jail ."
"Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.	i am glad they got out . i hope they get caught i would be furious if it was me"
"Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully, those animals can find good care and good homes.	i ' m a pretty big advocate of the government , i feel the same way about animal rescue . it really helps a lot ."
"And in my opinion, the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough - they should have had to stay in jail!	yeah , it ' s a shame . . . the jail time was just the perfect fit for them"

"How old are they?	oh , you ' re the parent ! i know it ' s old but back then i was the parent ! lol"
"Enjoy them now!  Mine are 17, 15, and 10 and too cool for *everything*.  LOL	My two best friends are going on vacation next week and I won't have anyone else at work to goof off with.	oh , that ' s a bit sad . i ' m sorry . how long until they go ?"
"On the one hand, I hope so but on the other hand, I'll get bored because there's nothing to break up the day.  Just straight...ugh!  XD	you must be quite happy ! have you been reading about the past ?"
"I went for a walk the other day and one of the neighbors dogs was loose, a bit white husky, he was aggressive.	oh my goodness , what was he doing ? ! is he ok ?"
