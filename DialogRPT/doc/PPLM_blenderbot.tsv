"Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.	oh my god that sounds so scary , how old were you then ?"
"No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.	i feel so sorry for you and tell you how sad it is ."
"I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.	Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places	that ' s awesome ! i ' m really hoping so . i want to know how that went ."
"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?	my car was very shaky and it almost rained all night but i am okay thankfully no one was hurt and i got a cab so i was able to drive home but that night i didn ' t have anyone to drive with . thank you so diligence"
"I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together	do whatever you can , and get over it . you both will always be together together no matter what"
"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world	thats wonderful to hear . you both must have been strong with each other . maybe you can get away to see each other soon ?"
"I couldn't wait to go to the concert.	whar is happening to be there ? will you be having an enjoyable time in the event ?"
"The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!	what a wonderful first date ! i ' m happy for you !"
"I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors	that ' s very sad ! but it ' s hard not to worry about it . your parents are probably just like me and it will be fine ."
"she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying	i feel like this kind of thing shouldn ' t happen , but in this day and age we have to go through all kinds of these treatments for babies ."
"yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors	so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up	are you a doctor ? or a nurse ? how sad . please be so kind for him up- - and what did you do ?"
"i was singing nursery songs :)	oh poor thing ! how long did it take you to sing ?"
"If you happy and you know it :)	my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon	how sounds like he has a good position to fill , hopefully he ' ll find one soon ! hopefully his husband has a good - full time job ."
"thank you so much!	that ' s so sad to hear , i ' m sure he will find one soon ! it sucks not having a side job , but i hope he gets a good one soon !"
"he is an armed guard	i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods!	oh my goodness ! how exciting ! do you know who that was ?"
"I do! I want to be able to protect my son	oh boy . . . maybe you should start by teaching yourself first"
"i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years	you seem very excited ! are they coming back to visit soon ?"
"I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry	congratulations , i ' m happy for you . when are you headed back ?"
"I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident	oh no , was he okay ? or is he just being lazy ? i ' m sorry that was very bad of him , i hope you guys learned from it"
"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	i ' m sorry to hear that . that sounds terrible . there are ways to get in trouble if you dont want to tell the truth ."
"Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.	So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer	i better go back and return it lol , that is a rip off"
"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!	i ' m sorry , i ' m still looking for the tv myself . maybe you can buy a side hustle from a friend . or get a lemon or something ."
"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed	My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	you ' re a loyal and honest friend , and still a good friend . you know how that goes , and it ' s not a reason to be scared or hesitant about changing your partner ' s over the years . as long as he ' s a good friend , i ' m sure he ' ll let you guys know what ' s going on . you probably should work on it as it is , but i say stay confident in your relationship ."
"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	well , that was very thoughtful of you . was she honest with you about it ? i am sure if you tell her , she will feel better about the situation ."
"my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house	i am sure it will be a lot of fun . have you tried to feed it diet and exercise ?"
"i totally agree with you!	yes oh baby sleeping ! that must be so awesome ! i bet ! that sounds like a dream to have a baby !"
"hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country	awww that really stinks . what are your default friends@ ?"
"i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	that ' s interesting . do you have a good friend group group ?"
"I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.	it ' s very frustrating when children seem to refuse to learn , especially when they act so imresponsible . parents can really drive you insane when they get so mad ."
"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!	they just want to get what they cant in order . . . no matter how bad they do . . they dont care"
"I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died	oh no ! i would have been terrified ! what was it"
"Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy	I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.	oh that ' s cool . what happened ? did everything work out ?"
"Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	i ' m glad it went well and it reminded you of your past experiences ! what happened next ?"
"Thank you! That means a lot.	One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	oh yes ! did you cry , cry , laugh , cry , cry ?"
"Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	i have been there my friend . you will always love your child . i have 3 and only one on my hands ."
"Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	my wallet has been through been through . i know how you feel"
"Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.	oh i actually know what you mean ! when in the nick of time is the last day of payday . ."
"Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	what was the incident ? i am so glad to hear that ."
"My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	that ' s so great , i can ' t imagine how thankful you are for her . what is your favorite thing about the incident ?"
"Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	wow , how interesting . you must be very multi faceted"
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	i agree , it is great how you can listen to your feelings , mine is always very directly opposite"
"I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	very nice , how old are you ? before you know it , you ' ll be on your final destination ."
"I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there	i am still so happy for you ! it is such a wonderful surprise ."
"I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	yeah that does sound lonely . do you try to hang out with other girls ?"
"Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	oh boy , it is just like losing a mate . it is only when they see you that you are lonely , does it make you feel better ? i would try not to think about it too much"
"As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	not silly at all ! i bet that is a good time of the year haha"
"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	as a still student of git- can you tell me a bit about this experience ?"
"The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	is it your first time reading any of your new documents ?"
"Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	wow . . . i am so sorry how did that happen ? i would have been really annoyed . sorry about that ."
"I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	i bet it was ! where did you visit ? how far away was it ?"
"Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	i ' ve i know that feeling , although i ' m an outtie ."
"My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	oh my gosh , have you used your full force from this conversation ? have you two been friends for long ?"
"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	she got us all together with video cameras and video chatting . but for me , it was different as she was very young . i ' m older , i don ' t really have that experience , but i have my own parents to blame"
"But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	do oh well , sometimes we all do stupid things in life . it is still a good thing to look back on"
"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	have you felt awkward about it since then ? or has it changed your life ?"
"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.	that is so sad . : ( but you are very fortunate that you found out when facebook first came out ."
"I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	oh congratulations on your new worker ! i bet you are a great uncle or aunt"
"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	what do you write about ? i never read an english book before ."
"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	honestly , i don ' t know anyone in my life . i ' m just a pretty introvert , trying to break the habit of setting myself in a good place . i ' m thinking about becoming a pianist , hopefully with good practice ."
"My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	do how big is the baby ? how many has it grown ?"
"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	that ' s strange . . . maybe it ' s because she ' s moving"
"Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	oh how long did you run for ? did you train for it ?"
"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	have you been running a marathon since before your first one ?"
"We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	well done nice story ! i must admit that i do not know what a shame shame that would be ! i know that sounds amazing but what a great achievement , too ! is there a eta in darvanese marathon ?"
"I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	where oh how cool ! was it a famous person ? if you don ' t mind me asking ."
"She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	oh , that is so sad , i hate when that happens . what happened ?"
"I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	bullying is a horrible thing to have happen on the side of the kids"
"How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	i agree . sometimes bullying can be very emotionally and physically tense . however , i feel that sometimes kids are just exposed to a lot of trauma from childhood and need therapy to cope with it . that ' s why some parents make it a point to avoid bullied kids"
"Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	oh no that is so sad . was the cat okay ?"
"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	good on you ! how is your daughter now ? i could use a little cat guy to belonged to me ."
"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	oh how exciting ! how long have your kids been married ?"
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	what i love it ! tucson has a lot of cool hills and things to do there , so that ' s fun ! but you ' re right , it was so beautiful !"
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	oh thats nice . did you guys have good conversation ?"
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	oh my goodness ! i hope you guys were able to go somewhere and meet up then ! is he happy ?"
"Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	i actually really like it . it makes it organized and i love it"
"Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	i love to organize my house ! i ' m kind of a messy person , but i find myself very few episodes of my shows . i can ' t stand the idea of having to change all that stuff ."
"I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	that ' s not a good habit . have you ever sent an email to them ?"
"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	do you send nudes to your husband or girlfriends ? i send them to my husband , and he does the same thing ."
"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	oh , how come i hope you two didn ' t fight for too long"
"I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	oh no , why were you guys mad ? i ' ve never had an argument with a temper before ."
"I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	that ' s pretty neat ! what makes you so lonely when you first moved out of the country ?"
"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	oh wow ! well that sounds like a wonderful adventure ! i ' m happy you got to travel with the baby , and congratulations on your well wishes !"
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	oh , i know ! that is so annoying ! i never know what to expect when it comes to people being knowledgeable about developing a skill 3 "" . is it because it ' s too tough for them to use their skills ?"
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	i am just a homebody . i am afraid i will fail again , i am just so disappointed in the past ."
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	you don ' t see it like that , they are human and if you treat them the way they treat you , they will eventually adapt i believe ."
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	that ' s great that you guessss . your husband must have felt sorry for you . sometimes he has to make his own mistakes , i understand . i hope you have something in mind for his appointment"
"There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	oh man . that ' s very sweet . i bet your son is beautiful !"
"Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	really well done . i hope i can be trusted someday when my son ' s going to be a man , he will learn to look for those better looking girls ."
"Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	that ' s a good point ! i wish i would be more careful with my health , i always get too scared ."
"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	yeah , that ' s so true . no one can take care of you while in a situation like that ! it ' s good you are reaching out to others so you can try to be there for them !"
"Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	that must be a bittersweet feeling . i love the time mine was little lol"
"Are your kids adults now?	oh yes . i understand what you mean . they are adults , but they are getting old . i try to remember how they grow up with each new phase ."
"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	i know what that means , i am sure you looked great !"
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	sometimes you just have to start with a simple solution , keep at it ! but don ' t let too much confidence stop you from trying !"
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.	what do you guys do for ourselves ? do you enjoy it ?"
"We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	congratulation , that is really great news . i also work for myself and i ' m glad to hear you ' re able to secure secure money . not too many people do so now"
"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected	hey ok , whats the matter ? what happened ? was it awkward ?"
"Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	wow , where were you two on when you first met ?"
"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	that ' s quite the honor ! how exciting for you . i have always been pretty good at subtracting the ying yu weelys when it comes to giving tips for mes , but it sounds like you ' re quite talented at giving . i hope you have a lot of fun , i ' m just not sure what to expect ."
"We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	oh man . sounds like a whole new experience . i ' ve never even heard of a luptojet condo before . that sounds very nice . do you have some family planning on making friends in miramar and getting involved in remodeling ?"
"I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	that sounds pretty fun . did you have some good food to eat ?"
"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	i am so sorry to hear that . you must feel disappointed ."
"Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	oh , that sounds scary ! what happened next ? did he give you a piece of mind or something ?"
"Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	wow that ' s creepy . what did you do when he followed you back ?"
"Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	yeah you sure did ! what happened ? i must have missed it . can you tell me ?"
"She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	ohh , what ! that sounds like an instance oh my gosh ! ! how terrible ! but hey that sounds like a relief that she got killed ! what happened ? !"
"Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	hey , everyone has looked like that at some point in life ! don ' t beat yourself up about it . i ' m sure it will be ok ."
"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	what a night , huh ? you are such an famous person , how come ?"
"Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	no , what happened ? ! how did you go ? !"
"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!	beyonce is really amazing , have you been to any of her concerts before ?"
"You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...	did you go home and try to search for your girlfriend ?"
"My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!	my friend trinidad ghted the night to died in a drunk sleeps with the lights on when i got home from new york night . how long ago was this ?"
"Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!	congratulations ! you must be quite happy to find your love ! is this your first time having a ring ?"
"I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!	thats so nice . im guessing you guys never got married ?"
"I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!	oh , that is good news . how ' d it go ?"
"This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?	that sounds like a nice interview . do you want to do another stroke of luck ?"
"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?	nope . tell me about it . tell me about it ."
"As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	good job on you> you monster ! you should sue him !"
"I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	i understand that . that ' s crazy . did your friend react the same way ?"
"I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	oh my god that sounds awful ! so bad ! did your friend understand how you felt ?"
"This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	that ' s terrible , what happened to your fridge ? did it not make a difference ?"
"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	i am sorry that happened to you . my oh my , i hate it when that happens ."
"I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	it ' s hard to tell her about it after in a relationship but you should never have kept it to yourself ! if it is not best for you both . i can ' t imagine why you wouldn ' t tell your sadistic relationship with your friend ."
"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	i would be so scared i would be so upset . did you tell her ?"
"I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	hahaha it ' s ok , everyone farts in the presence of a mom , and they do it for the most part"
"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching	oh , wow ! that sounds like a lot of trauma ! haha i hope you were able to laugh about it afterwards . did you have fun at the mall ?"
"THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!	I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!	what are you planning on doing when you ' re done ?"
"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.	that sounds awesome . i have always wanted to go on vacation too ."
"I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	that is so cool ! do you know how long it ' s going to take for her to get a job ?"
"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))	do it ' s crazy how the world now has relaxed around you and you can make what you want ."
"Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	what is your favorite pet peeve ? lol i see that all the time"
"Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	have you ever thought about signing up for a kayaking class ?"
"WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)	I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!	oh my goodness that ' s exciting ! how exciting for you ! do you have any special recipe for success ?"
"We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.	i ' m so happy for you ! what a happy moment for your future baby !"
"Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second	I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.	congratulations , my friend ! i have never been in too much meetings but i bet i could help you during one"
"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	not a know bit of that at all . i ' m an itan if you know . i thought it was quite interesting but not much into it . i ' m sure you know what it ' s like though ."
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	yeah it ' s definitely a sign of good character and organisation , people like that !"
"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	i agree completely , i think its good that our leaders try to be healthy and happy instead of overspend ."
"I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	that sounds like a wonderful memory . . have you decided what to feed them ?"
"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot"", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.	that is so cute ! i know that movie made you cry !"
"This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt	what what did she get ? a car ? flowers ? cake ?"
"Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards	what was in the cards* ? i am so glad you had a great mother ' s day !"
"THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?	i guess i just haven ' t done my best , but i will have to focus more when it ' s time to go into that field ."
"Did they give you any feedback?	i have no idea . i ' m still waiting for my spam email from the professorber to be sent to me - i ' m waiting to hear back ."
"That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.	yeah they were feedback that i ' m trying to do better next time . but its a learning experience ."
"So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.	oh congratulations to you ! that is exciting ! i hope they are excited and it will be a boy !"
"I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	that is so exciting ! i have twins but i am also a mother and i hope they have an amazing experience and fantastic time raising the baby . she must be excited to be pregnant !"
"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	i ' m not sure , i can ' t wait to learn what happened next . i have just been through and i am a little embarrassed that i lost my card"
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	i stayed netflix is pretty good for that . i watched one episode and then the next one i didn ' t get too far in , so i missed out . i am sorry i couldn ' t find anything eweirder . netflix is better for me , since i don ' t have to deal with hulu , but you can watch different kinds of movies i guess"
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	i ' ve i think i will give that one too . i never heard of it . i love scary shows . i will have to check it out ."
"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	congratulations ! you must be extremely proud of yourself ! you should be proud of yourself ! i hope that was very exciting to go through that and know it worked out for you !"
"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.	holy cow ! that ' s amazing . you will get it next time i bet you will have to work for less , right ?"
"Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job	Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!	have you ever tried paintpainting ? it can help a lot with the frustration in finding traffic ."
"Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes	yikes , that is quite annoying to deal with . i guess the only way to resolve is to try to avoid it again ."
"The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.	which movie was it ? i remember the grudge . i never finished i liked deep blue sea ."
"And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.	i ' m sorry that you felt that way , i would be scared to death if i was there . it ' s an amazing movie ."
"My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.	sounds like she had an excellent first year but you must be proud , people just wait until they finish , there are people like that in school"
"She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.	that ' s great , good for her . there is no better feeling than being able to give back to a friend who is great at what they do !"
"I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.	Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown.	oh that ' s really funny ! did you try to tell your girlfriend ?"
"I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.	that could be an issue ! i hope you can get it all fixed out ."
"I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too.	I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out	good job ! ! ! ! cute ! ! what kind of puppy is it ?"
"Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!	that sounds amazing ! congratulations ! you must be pretty excited ."
"When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them	what a wonderful situation you had . parents . it is amazing how parents can help their children in such a way ."
"Yes, I am always better off with them as my parents, they want to see us succeed	that is so awesome that your parents were so helpful and helpful with you !"
"Yes, it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.	do wow , i will probably try not to pick up beautiful high internet support so i can help you more as well , your parents sound very grateful ."
"Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married	wow that ' s amazing . i am so happy for you . i know it is a huge achievement !"
"My friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary. He easily makes 200,000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him.	i make a similar wage each year and just drive an car and a house alone . make sure you have time for your hobby though . you have to work hard to earn that ."
"Yeah, that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance, and is on call a lot.	i know that would be hard . but if he ' s able to raise prices quickly , the increase will help him a lot . a lot of people already have the insurance prices covered , so he should at least be able to move on from there ."
"True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.	I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future	oh , that sounds interesting , did it go well ? was it about something you did or was it about your job ?"
"I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path	oh congratulations on that ! i am sure you will do fine ."
"That is disgusting! What can you do about about it?	i don ' t know . i feel really bad . i ' m going to give this mourns how i am . but i ' m not going to tell him to stop . he is on his own , and just decided to share it online because he found it ."
"You could chat to them and complain!	i usually get into trouble for that because the floor is so gross . but i don ' t know if that ' s a good damn invitation for me to post on social media ."
"Who knows, I guess it depends on how reasonable they are.	One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at, my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.	did you go in her night without her ? i hope she made a good impression on you !"
"I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.	are you going to be spending a lot of time together ? i ' m really looking forward to seeing you guys after all that time ."
"She also has 2 daughters, 2 and 7, and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.	lol , she must be excited ! how old are the gecko ' s ?"
"I've known them since the moment they were born, but it will still be a blast.	Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood	i remember that feeling too ! toys r us was so much fun when i was a kid . i loved seeing the deal with toys r us and signing up with their kids stuff ."
"I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era	toys r us was a terrible place ! i remember going there for toys and wearing my little trends . toys r us was a ghost town ."
"The other day I came across a Facebook post showing all the old stuff from the 90's.. it took me way back to my childhood.	nice , what did you see ? i bet you were super excited !"
"Oh no, it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends, food, toys, tv shows, etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.	that must have been a pretty wonderful experience . i am sure you can understand how excited i am about that ."
"How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.	i was a child in the 90s . i have an oldie , but goodie !"
"Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.	I hate bullies. Playground or politics, I find them intolerable.	yeah how is it their first day on the bus , especially after they have been bullied for days ?"
"Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?	i said some of them worse , like when my son was talking to his potential teacher about the past ."
"I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.	is usually in which tly some giving tells ? i would like to watch some"
"Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.	how much why do you think it was bad ? were you able to understand any of the spoken caption ?"
"My parents keep taking my money	oh no . what are they going to do really do about it ' s ?"
"They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.	if you google , you can get a full account . you can also try and start saving it up in casserole form ."
"So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a ""mommy"" will come along to clean up after them?!	i have no idea ! ! that is so irritating . there is nothing more frustrating and annoying than when an adult tries to talk about it and then leaves without a head . makes me think of the people in my office who have never worked before and don ' t know what kind of work they are doing !"
"LOL! Okay, y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)	oh man ! so tell me what happens on the ants situation , my friend ."
"The hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on Christmas of 2007.	oh my goodness , i ' m so sorry for your loss . it is hard for people to lose a loved one properly ."
"She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up, she slipped.	wow , so hard to see that . i am so sorry ."
"It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it, but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.	aww , that is so sad . i hope that she is ok ."
"It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.	that ' s so cool , you must be very strong . is she always shy about changing her name ?"
"A few years ago, there was a time that I really needed a car. I had to go to school and my husband worked full time.	you must be excited ! what are you going to do now ?"
"We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!	very cool ! what did you end up naming it ? it was a google drive car ?"
"Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind.	oh that ' s cool ! and yeah , people can be so great ! i ' m glad you ' re happy to share that information . it ' s nice to know that people are so caring and kind these days ."
"Have you ever had a surprise birthday party planned for you? I did a few years back.	yes i did in high school . it was just to surprise me , not because of anything i have been doing on my own hipster year ."
"That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year.	that ' s funny . i went to one recently , but i didn ' t have many friends . so it was for sure a surprise"
"Haha! Yes! And what's really funny, is that I almost missed it because I wasn't actually expecting it and almost didn't get back in time! Whoops.	It was raining hard one night and the power shut off	i would have been so upset ! do you know what happens when you shut the power sever off ?"
"Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles	wow , that ' s a lot of money . that must have been a scary day . is there anything in particular you are hoping to learn about the recover from the lighters term ?"

"Haha I always thought that was a funny term too. That's amazing. Psychology is absolutely fascinating.	Do you have any pets?	i do not , i am afraid of animals . how about yourself ?"
"Yes. We got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! He's such a night owl and is always banging into stuff.	oh man , that ' s me , i have 2 dogs and a cat . they are the most annoying bugs ever !"
"My son graduated.	wow ! that ' s awesome ! what is his bestening moment in life ."
"Highschool.	wow that ' s so exciting . he must have a great future seniority to graduate ."
"One of the hardest times in my life was when I had to leave my husband and daughter when I went through a divorce.	oh no , that must have been traumatic . how are you feeling now ?"

"It was, but I grew so much from it, and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.	I know this guy who is so young, yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.	that ' s awesome , what kind of business is it ?"
"He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.	wow ! that sounds really cool ! has he sold any of his own beans ?"
"I feel slightly bad. I think I hurt my mom's feelings last week because she told me about a necklace I got rid of when I was a kid. She's a packrat and I'm really, really not.	ah , don ' t feel bad . you could have bought yourself a treat !"

"No, they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.	oh wow that is very nice of her ! i ' m sure she would appreciate it ! that ' s wonderful ."
"Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?	yeah that is so annoying ! when that happens to me ! i think it is only on the phone ."
"Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..	oh yeah ! i have ! i think it ' s amazing how the radio can make you feel that way ! what are you reading today ?"
"lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)	I was just thinking about how a few years ago, we lost our cat.	oh no , that ' s so sad . i had the same thing happen to me . it ' s awful templates to say the least ."

"The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha	haha , exactly . just wish i hadn ' t already passed away ."
"Agreed, definitely not. I actually work in radiation oncology and see cancer every day at work.	Once I ate a raw oyster because my uncle offered me some and I contracted food poisoning. Things were coming out from both ends, so gross.	that ' s interesting , how did you initially get used to the food poisoning ?"
"Extremely, but it passed after a day or so. Never consume raw shellfish, unless sushi because they properly prepare it	that ' s absolutely disgusting . yeah , it ' s the first time in about 15 years that i ' ve seen an adult give another human or animal meal without telling them they ' re safe for them ."
"You don't care for sushi that much?	I recently had a prank played on me. My friend pretended to be dead and used ketchup as a prop!	oh my , did they get mad at you ? do you regret the prank ?"
"I ended up being very upset at first and then laughed it off!	oh , that is hilarious , and yet so sad . . . i can ' t imagine how embarrassed you must of felt ! did you laugh about it later ?"
"My boyfriend of five years and I broke up. I don't know what to do with my life.	thats too bad . do you think you can make it through this time ?"
"I don't think so. He wants to join the military since his dad has passed away and I'm not sure if that's the lifestyle I want.	do you think he will know what to do with his time in the military if he ends up joining ?"
"I think we're going to try long distance while I finish up school (3 more years). But it's just scary thinking of it all.	oh i see . yes , i understand your gut , i know it would be tough . you ' ll know for sure if it is for the best what he wants and what he will want in the military ."
"We have dogs and chameleons together, so it's like we're already a little family haha	long distance can be tough . do you have friends at least ?"
"I recently found out the girl I love may not feel the same way. This makes me sad.	do you think that you two will be able to make it work out ?"

"I am very lucky, my friends are so great. What's the best birthday you have had?	i had a very good birthday as well , that was a very special my freshman year of high school . i had had a good time 3 years of my parents ' secret life was stolen and when my friend returned home , i was blown away . it was a great memory !"
"Wow, I am impressed! My friends just show me love and buy me tequila aha!	my best birthday was probably today ' s , i went to a fancy restaurant with my mom . i could have asked her to help me pick out a dress ."
"For sure, maybe you need new friends!	5	how not will you read my instructions when you are done ?"
"I recently had an argument with my sister. It made us both very annoyed.	oh wow , i ' m sorry that must have irritated you both . what was the fight about ?"
"I recently had a scary experience. I heard gunshots on my street.	oh no , what happened ? did you give any name ?"
"Everything turned out fine. I think somebody in the nearby neighborhoods may have been hurt, though.	i am so sorry that you had that experience . that ' s absolutely scary . did you call the police ?"
"Do you know the feeling of drinking a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows on a cold winter's night?	i am afraid i do . how old is your friend now ?"
"Next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it. It's extremely relaxing and sleep-inducing haha	i ' ll try it out ! maybe we can go to your place to meet an honest moment . what ' s your favorite thing to do in the cold front ?"
"I live in Louisiana, so it's very rare that I get to enjoy it. I've had it maybe three or four times in my lifetime. It just left a lasting impression.	I love my mom. She does her best to provide for me, even to this day.	it is great that your mom is good at what she does . you should use the golden year"
"I tell her I love her and also send her gifts from time to time. She doesn't live too close to me but I try.	are you sure you are not too close to her ? you seem a lot closer to her than her i am sure you are !"
"You know, that is tough, but it happens to the best of us. What went wrong?	i had i text him some more in the chat , i ' ll talk to him today"
"But you failed the exam? Did you revise?	i thought i was really good and was passed the test but still had to pay some guilt about it . i just really don ' t understand it ."
"At least you know for next time eh?	My mom helped me buy a car. She's the best.	oh wow that ' s really nice ! how much did you pay for it ?"
"She's amazing. Do you love your mom?	yes , i love her very much . she also gave me my first car for free !"
"I think that the girl of my dreams likes somebody else. I feel very sad about it.	do you have a proposed proposal ? i think you can ask her if it is for her first ."
"It's tough because she has been out of the country for a month, so I will likely discuss it when she returns.	you should probably tell her before it gets too sad . what are you worried about ?"
"That sounds tough. What do you do/	i ' m just trying to get i the job i want , teach english in the finance department , lawyerades a lot of things and get motivated to learn and become a lawyer ."
"That sounds like hard work. I hope you are paid well.	i work i ' m a freelancer , and thank you . i have a full time job , and i do ton of freelance work - make my own freelance work . i deserve it !"
"Fair enough. As long as you look after your back""	I have only a few more semesters in college. I feel very hopeful about my chances of finishing.	good luck ! what do you want to study ? i am studying finance"
"Environmental engineering! I enjoy it, but I wouldn't say it is my passion in life.	it sounds like a cool field ! good luck . what do you think you will do ?"
"I watch so many scary movies that I haven't been able to sleep alone in years due to fear.	how what are some of them ? i ' m always curious to know ."
"I honestly don't know. I've always been fascinated with them since being a little girl and that fascination has never gone away.	well what kind of movies do you watch ? it can help a lot to be brave and let yourself relax ."
"I've been telling myself that for years, I just have no self control. What are your favorite kinds of movies?	i love action and comedies mostly . myself and communities mostly ."
"What is your favorite scary movie at the moment?	i really enjoy during the week , i really like scary movies when im well prepared for it . and when im on the train with the train ."

"Do you like to go through old family pictures?	i do sometimes , when i think of old friends and family . i don ' y ' t get why people do it , but sometimes i feel weird ."
"Absolutely. I love to hear my mÃ¡mÃ¡ tell me stories from her childhood trapping nutria and trawling with her family.	that sounds like a lot of fun ! i like old family photos as well , but its nice to see the feet on the fence you sit in ."

I recently found out that the woman of my dreams like another. I am incredibly jealous of him.	why do you think that he isn ' t another ? is he just going to randomly say that ?"
"I have not told her as much as I need to. I am trying to build the courage.	when i am sure you are excited for it ! just tell her and say something and if she or he accept it it won ' t be a big deal"

"Yeah, I was pretty amazed in the moment, he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face. I had to watch for a moment in awe, before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So, I ran towards where the parents were seated, stopped when I turned the corner, and walked calmly over to my mom, taking a seat on her lap. I looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner, and I forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop, I looked like a helpless victim.	oh my god that is amazing , i have only seen that before but it sounds like it is a really long story"

"Really? I didn't even know that was an option. Then again I'm 25 so it may not have been available then.	that stinks . if it wasn ' t available you can ' t have it . at least public schools don ' t leave kids with home school like they used to ."

"My wife had been out of the country for 2 months for school.  I left early to get to the airport to get her when she came back because I was excited to see her.	oh that is wonderful ! i am sure she will enjoy the visit ."
"Yeah, it's especially long since we only recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	oh wow that must be really tough . are you guys going to go back to school ?"
"I wish my neighbors were more considerate. They woke me up at 4am recently.	that ' s a shame ! what do you do to make them wake you up late ?"
"No point. Their smoke alarm went off and management don't care anyway.	have you complained ? they usually get different attitudes ? i bet that would help you out"
"Me too! I really don't appreciate their lack of manners - it's as if they own the whole complex!	my friend came over yea=sterday and we were sitting on the couch chit chatting and when i got up i accidentally farted. so embarrasing	what a horrible thing to happen ! i hope he didn ' t give you a moment of regret"
"she did, she didn't say anything but i know she heard it	oh my god , it was really embarrassing . you were too young to know that . i hope she didn ' t say anything ."

"Hello ... I give thanks for the good things and the things that do not, the good things make me feel good and the satisfaction and the bad things are internal growth	this is very sad , you must be feeling sad . but i am happy to give our thoughts ."
"For me it was a hard learning ... but after many blows ... I assimilated it	good job , that is something to be proud of . i am proud of you ."
"for a year ... you assimilate it when you realize that you are responsible ... neither the people nor the circumstances are responsible	yeah . you know , i don ' t feel so bad about it . i hope your sister pulls through ."
"condition the mind and spirit	oh i understand now , but why don ' t you ask her again ?"
"I lost my mother to breast cancer several years ago and I am still grieving the loss.	oh im sorry to hear that . how did she die ?"
"yes, I talk about it but it really does not help much. I pray a lot and that gives me some comfort	i am so sorry . it must be hard for you . it is so hard to lose a parent . how old was she ?"
"I dont have a pastor, or a church I can go to. I meditate and I pray and I watch preachers on Sunday morning tv. All of those do help some.	I had plans to move from Florida to California, but I'm starting to get cold feet...	oh no ! i am guessing that you do not like california then ?"
"Ohh! Did you change your mind? I'm trying to convince myself that it's going to be better for me to make the move.	what are you less concerned about change ? the cold is a lot worse for me ."
"today I think today is a day to learn, to hug, to smile, to make someone happy	oh that sounds very exciting ! do you have any pets or children ?"
"that's right ... but I dedicate an hour to do that, to my children I kiss them, my neighbor smiled at him and from life I try to learn something	you are very generous ! how long did you sit around at that hour for ?"
"It makes me feel good that my reflection serves you ... I send you a smile	I'm so lonely. I mean... i have no friends, no husband, no kids. i wish i had at least somebody in my life	don ' t feel bad . there are plenty of fish in the sea . there ' s plenty of fish in the sea ."
"not really. i love playing video games and watch tv. i'm socially awkward	oh my gosh ! ! ! i feel you ! i am also socially formualed- i watch tv with video games and video games as well !"
"My wife has been out of the country for almost 2 months.  I can't wait to go pick her up at the airport!	oh really , where is she going ? is she going to be back ?"
"I'm assuming you got cut off somehow :P  I'm very happy she's coming back.	luckily , i didn ' t get cut off . i made well . i ' m glad you ' re excited about her return . where is she going ?"
"Germany for a language immersion course.	I am so thrilled to be able to go on a short but long overdue vacation	what will you be doing in the meantime ? ! how do you hope to do it ?"
"A short weekend trip to the ozarks for a float trip on spring fed white water.	oof that ' s crazy . . you must be very excited . . hope you ' ll get to see some cool things too !"
"Down close to the border line of arkansas and the ozarks. It is around the current river	I was planning my wedding and trying to get a caterer.  The one we were looking at was completely ignoring every time my wife tried to communicate with them, to the point where I told them off and went with someone else.	wow , it ' s like the ones who don ' t listen are trying to be just a part of the project and not you . i ' m sure they just don ' t get it ."
"Yeah, it was weird, the caterer was a woman so I can't imagine it was like a sexism thing, but she responded to me almost instantly every time.	she was probably busy trying to fool you , like the one you just asked for !"
"I got a free pizza from Domino's but felt bad about how it happened.	oh man , how ' d you get it ? did you have a good feeling ?"
"The pizza took forever to get delivered so I asked if it was free.  The delivery girl, who was brand new, didn't know so she just didn't charge me.	domino ' s is a great restaurant ! i ' m a huge fan of their food !"
"Well, I like free pizza for sure. But I still felt a bit concerned that they might take the cost of it out of her paycheck.	how was your day?	it was pretty great . im feeling pretty good about it nyu . . how about you ?"
"yeah good. whats your name?	i have no name , but i hope to find someone to share my personal statement with sometime soon - when will you tell me your secret ?"
"oh its fine nice to chat with you unknown friend	hello how was your day?	it was well , how was yours ? did you have any sand in your enws ?"
"yeah fine great day	well , how was yours ? it was pretty good ! what about you ?"
"yeah nice to talk to you.	I wore wrong pair of socks to the college. But, no was there to spot it. But, when we have to go in for a church we have to first remove the shoes. At, that time friend of mine spotted with with wrong pair of shoes. They made a fun of me. That was very awkward situation.	oh , no ! no shame in ourselves . but hey , we ' ve all made embarrassing situations like that when we first go in for a church ."
"My room was messy as there was a party last night in my house and friends were enjoying in whole house. That is the reason.	ah ! that does sound very awkward . did your friends notice you and noticed the pair of socks you had ?"
"ohh	I went for a job interview, and it seemed to go pretty well.	i hope you got the job : ) go on . ."
"It should be a couple weeks, assuming they go at the pace they said they would.	what kind of job are you hoping for ? just one ?"
"I moved far away from my hometown for the first time so my wife could go to grad school.  It's hard to be away from my friends.	did she graduate up studying ? i bet you miss them a lot ."
"Yeah, definitely, that's why I went ahead with the move.  I'm just not very good at meeting people, so it can be tough.	it sounds like it has gotten easier as you get older . maybe you can start a new chapter in your life that is normal for you and move forward with it ."
"I took my wife to the airport for her trip out of the country for 2 months.  I felt really bad on the way home.	oh , you must have been a bit nervous , why did you feel bad ?"

"Germany for a language course.	I almost got in a fight in a drive-thru lineup.	what happened ? what happened ? did you guys have a fight ?"
"No, the person cut in front of some other people.  I confronted him about it and we got into a shouting match.	omg , what did you do ? do you know what happened ?"
"Yes, afterwards I regretted the confrontation.  I thought I could have easily been shot.	I got on a stranger's boat by accident at the marina.	oh my ! what a beautiful feeling . did you have fun ?"
"Fortunately the owner didn't see me before I got off, but I sure felt stupid about it.	oh , i bet ! how big was the boat ? did you at least get to be on it without damage ?"
"Indeed.  And next time I'll be sure to double-check whose it is before I come aboard.	I was looking at old pictures from my first ""adult"" apartment, and thinking about all the times I spent there with friends and roommates.	did you ever find a new place ? it ' s always nice to relive those times"
"It can, but it can also hurt sometimes.  It's probably just nostalgia hardcore, but sometimes I wish I could go back to that time.	i know i know what you mean , life doesn ' t get much worse than that ."
"Last night was crazy. I couldn't relax even though I really wanted to. I was in a house full of people screaming and yelling.	what exactly did you do ? was it forwarding ?"
"My friend and her mom were fighting about money, and my friend's daughters were wanting attention.	oh wow , that is crazy ! i ' m glad your night went smoothly ! what happened ?"
"I hope so too. I plan on going back to my place just to get away from all of this.	I had a job interview today and i think it really well.	oh yeah what is the job , what do you think it was ?"

"I saw a picture of a dog on reddit that looked a lot like mine so I called out the person saying it was a picture of my dog, but it turned out I was wrong.  Whoops.	oh my gosh , that is the best . . . and saddest thing i ' ve heard all day ! do you plan on learning more about your dog this summer ?"
"Yeah, I don't like calling people out in general, don't know what made me think to do it this time.	what happened ? did anyone see it ? did you say anything to them ?"
"I'm surprised the police are going to let they get away with it.	they should not though , its a shopkeeper and dangerous to do that and its 100% on them"
"I think the mailman might be mad at me because I keep ordering heavy items.	oh no , that is bad , why don ' t you just tell them you have a heavy list ?"
"My test results come back today. I do hope everythings ok.	i hope so , good luck . have you gone in for a test yet ?"
"I had an abnormal ekg and they did a stress test on my heart to make sure everything's alright.	i am so very sorry that you had to go through that . you must be so worried !"
"Absolutely! I'm just over-worrying because I've always been so healthy. Just a little stressed out.	I went back to my home where I grew up and a flood of good memories came bavk to me. I had so many fun times with my best friends when I was a child.	oh that sounds like a swell experience . i hope your friends were good at paying the price"
"Playing outside in the summer time. Many fun summer times. Swimming holes, icecream, catching fireflies.	oh that sounds like a great time , i also went back to my childhood ."
"Me too!	My parents gave me a car for graduating from college. It makes my life so much easier.	oh wow , that ' s awesome ! congratulations . how long awo"
"Thanks, now all I got to do is get a real career. I couldn't have done it with out them.	congratulations on the car . that is really a blessing . a real job is important"
"The more problems I have to deal with, the more faith, and faithful I become. I am stronger in my faith when bad things happen in my life and around me.	its good to be hopeful in life , and if you want to be positive then you should follow your dreams"
"I was told once by a dear departed friend that ""what ever floats a persons boat it good because it keeps people sane as long as no one is being hurt.	what about yourself ? i am there for you . i am really happy you are learning so much about yourself . just wait and it will become easier and funnier when you are off the news"
"yeh to that	I had a job interview yesterday that I thought went really well, but it didn't. They just emailed me back and told me that I didn't get the job.	i ' m sorry to hear that , i have to imagine you really don ' t want to hear that !"
"I'm just pretty embarrassed, I was so confident. This whole job hunting adventure has been a complete nightmare.	i am so sorry that you were so nervous ! i know you will get another job soon !"
"I can understand why you might be jealous of your coworker. I would try to keep your head up.	yeah , i hope so . it ' s really hard to keep my head up though . i know i should really make it up to them , but i feel like it just adds to the longer term relationship i have ."
"You said that you were envious of his promotion. It is understandable though.	i am just sad that my coworker is one of the worse working people around . he is the best one and i wish he was in charge ."
"Okay, I am glad to hear that you are no longer feeling jealous.	I just got a puppy, but I have to leave him at home while I go to work. I feel so bad.	awww . i hope you will have time to teach him a lesson ."
"Fortunately, no. I let him run around the house, but I feel like he gets bored, so I keep the TV on for him.	aww , that ' s kind of sad . what is his name ?"
"Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.	i stole from the store as well as the owner . it ' s a big difference ."
"If that is the case, I can understand why they had to do it. In circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain, then it is most definitely wrong.	the problem is , that the magazine said it was not his doing it . it was his , and the magazine said it was his . i ' m not sure what would qualify as wrong ."
"My dog disappeared while I was away at college.	where did your dog go ? did you find him ? i have a friend who 100 dogs we have each and he would love to know where he went"
"My mother was walking her in a park and the dog fell down a cliff.  She was never found or recovered.	that ' s terrible . did you find it ? did you have to take it to the vet or did someone take it ?"
"Yes, I loved her a lot.  It took a long time to get over but it was quite a long time ago at this point.	I'm looking forward to my niece arriving from Washington. I haven't seen her in 2 years!	oh that ' s so exciting ! how exciting for you . what is she doing there ?"
"Probably not, because she is 6 months pregnant. Her husband is in the military and is away, so she will be here when she has her baby.	do that is exciting , is it your first child ? if not , what will she be doing after she returns ?"
"Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors!	oh ok , i understand now . thank you ! but it ' s still very inspiring that you have done this . i am sure it will go over very well"
"Oh cool! What kind of doctor?	i think you just need to go to a pray away doctor and quit this ship ."

"5	A year ago, I found an injured baby kitten in the road while driving.	wow that is so cute ! what did you do with it ?"

"My brother recently proposed to his girlfriend, I'm really happy for him. :)	how exciting for him ! does he know where the ring is ?"
"Yeah, he gave her my grandmothers rings, since they were nice and we had them available. He's 23 so he's trying to save money, but still wanted her to have something nice.	he ' s 23 ! i bet you ' re happy . that ' s awesome ."

"I couldn't buy my brother his gift from an online retailer that starts with an A, because apparently they don't ship to Canada from their .com website. :(	wow , did you ask anyone else ? did they ask you for help ?"
"Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.	yeah , that seems very unusual . why couldn ' t they ship to you ?"
"she took me for $1600 in just 2 weeks. What a trap	are you okay ? did you cry for a few weeks ?"
"It's been 7 years and I'm still not over it	that ' s a good trap to set if you ask me . but i ' m sure it ' ll be fine if you keep it away ."
"Sat here by myself for 10 days straight. Car was in the shop being repaired	well that ' s cool . how did it go ? i hope you are enjoying yourself !"
"It did actually. Made me so mad. Now I have to save up again	oh man ! how much are you going to save for the plane ?"
"For 8 months we were led to believe we would move in to our own place. Lies	how did it go as long as you had been hoping to ? did you finally get out of the house ?"
"Instead her stupid grandma moved in to it!	oh no , well that sounds a bit scary is it not ? hopefully you won ' t have to wait for another house any time soon"
"At the time I didn't think it was bad. But after she told me she didn't actually like it, that made me think differently	that ' s too bad , how long ago was this ?"
"Well she had never done it before, so I thought it was special	i ' m glad that she caught on , but i guess sometimes those kinds of things aren ' t easy to find ."
"I'm very proud of her for traveling alone at 6 months pregnant	wow , that ' s crazy . did you go alone for any particular reason ?"
"Yes. It's a boy	when oh boy . sounds like a smart and nice girlfriend ."
"My child got sick and I had just made arrangements to go out of town on business.	oh my , i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope they will be okay ."

"I wish I had money. Then she'd sit with me instead of him	she sat with you ? hahaha how much longer you wanna date for ?"
"In the club	that is pretty funny , you shouldn ' t do that to her then ."
"I don't feel bad. It's not like I made her do it. She wanted to	oh ok , do you think you ' ll be able to teach her ?"
"She knew what she was doing. I don't care how old she was. She knew	yeah , you know what they say , knewerbehavior is when you get the best of both worlds . she was just being naughty . i ' m sure she appreciate you so much ."
"I know I will save the money I need for the baby	oh yeah for sure . it ' s good you are so young to give your kids such a hyperpower !"
"Just to keep on working as much as I can everyday	its are you already practicing or are you going to be pregnant ?"
"I wish I never did it now. I thought it wasn't going to come out	i hope you do not have to worry about that . but i am sure you will be ok ."
"Kinda. I thought it was a secret	oh man . how have you been waiting so long for this ."
"it was brutal	wow , really ? ? that is impressive , i ' m really happy for you !"
"i didnt shower for a few days and had an important meeting. I could tell that they could smell me. I became a tomato.	that is funny , well that must have been a relief to hear"
"yes. homeless for a bit	are you ok ? did you atleast shower ? that ' s good ."
"i feel really bad about cheating on my girlfriend with a mutual friend.. i cant even look her in the eye	did do what you needed to do ? you can ' t just pick and choose which ones to do . i suggest break up now and don ' t do it again ."

"yeah.. me and my partner are so proud of her	that ' s great , you and your partner should keep working on a good relationship , you sound like a good foster family !"
"i have always felt really guilty about lying to my parents	how oh no , what did you lie about ? just curious"
"yeah, but still.. that feeling never went away	eh oh no ! i know how that feels ! you should never go back to them again ."
"i never get anxious about knowing that i am fully prepared before i go somewhere	that is the feeling i have too . its good that you are prepared though . what do you hope to do with is be on the water before you go ?"
"well, i guess women are more detail oriented	you ' re right . i bet you got all the tools you need to make a new safe lifestyle and a family safe !"
"i feel like my girlfriend and i are soulmates.. i can never cheat on her	where do you plan on getting married ? may i ask where you ' re staying ?"

"once i had been hurt by girl friend and it hurts me more than anything in my life	how that ' s horrible , i ' m so sorry . how are you doing now ?"
"yeah that really sucks.	that ' s awful ! how long ago was it ? was she in a relationship ?"
"I fell down at work, and my khaki pants ripped open.	wow ! that must have been a pretty embarrassing moment ! i hope you didn ' t die !"
"I didn't. Luckily I had a spare pair of sweatpants in my trunk. I did end up looking rather odd with a suit jacket and sweatpants.	oh , man . did you manage to find another clothes change from your suit jacket to where you are wearing sweatpants ?"
"My grandpa is coming to visit!,5|5|5_5|5|5,	good for him ! i bet you can tell him a lot about him ."
"He is coming next week! We are going to play Bingo at the local American Legion every night!	that sounds wonderful ! sounds like fun ! how long are you guys going on for ?"
"I ate a gas station burrito for lunch. It was not very appetizing. Actually, it was absolutely horrible.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	oh no , what happened next ? ! ? ! ? !"
"Yes, and now my tummy has the rumblies. My workplace bathroom is a one-seater right next to my work crush's desk. I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.	oh no ! wait until you find out your girlfriend after all this time ! you should go see a doctor about it ."
"how was your day?	it was good . how was yours ? i ' m really looking forward to it ."
"yeah its an another good day	my day was fine . i got a nice juicy juicy sandwich , and someone was giving a nice bruise on my nose !"
"oh how was the climate there/	where did you go to school ? i was there when it happened ."
"I managed to accidently flash a dozen people	which oh wow . did you at least credit him ? did he do a good job !"
"it was windy and the wind caught my shirt.  I was like ""oops!	oh no , do you feel okay now ? sounds like something that has happened before ."
"Yes.  Luckily people around me thought it was amusing and not offensive	i have always more trust on my girlfriend	that is good , i am sure it is a good feeling in the back you both will make together ."
"yeah i do. i love her a lot	oh , ok . what makes you more trust over your spouses ?"
"what about you?	I have a big exam coming up! My nerves are getting to me.	oh , what subject ? sounds pretty exciting , what are you studying ?"
"Thanks! It is my final exam for a summer class studying Database Design. I actually should be taking it right now.	oh my god ! it sounds like you are going for a masters degree in shed development ? i wish you the best of luck !"
"I get to go the the zoo tomorrow! They opened an exhibit showcasing two of my favorite animal, the sloth!	wow , that sounds exciting ! i ' ve never been to the zoo ."
"They have sloths, hippos, elephants, bears!	that sounds really cool . i ' ve never been to the zoo ."
"I had a guest over that used my restroom, and they obviously have some sort of digestive issue! They didn't event tell me about it!	wow , thats rude ! do you think you ' ll be okay ?"
"Yes it is. Do you think I should confront them?	i don ' t think it is the best idea . there ' s no need to put yourself in their position ."
"i have been more happy	me then ? which one will you give the most spoons please ?"
"happier now beacuse i have been built a new house	that is awesome ! it is always good to work on that because once you have a place to live and your kids are in school or after school you are more productive as a whole and it can feel like you are finished too ."
"Back to school time is always stressful because of how much everything costs now.	i know , right ! it ' s really tough to see how much something can be paid now . and how much the beans have cost since yesterday"
"I was able to cover most of it but luckily I had a little help covering the rest of what my kids needed. Even a little help is a big deal	that ' s great that you had a person to help you out ! prices have steadily increased a lot since the old days and it ' s even harder to find your own clothes nowadays ."
"i have watched races in tv	how many you have ? which ones do you watch ? a bike through a mud is always fun ."
"nope iam a street racer	cool ! i have never been a street racerer myself but would love to try it out ."
"i feels happy	is that a good thing or a bad thing ? i ' m sorry to hear that ."
"because i built a new house	that ' s amazing ! congrats ! i have a family member who ' s gone through a similar struggle and i can see how it will make you feel great ."
"i have been more happy that i have bought a car	that ' s great ! i hope you enjoy your ride !"
"audi q7	nice , that sounds really fun . what did you buy ?"
"My wife bought me a new watch for my birthday! She is such a sweetheart.	that ' s super nice ! you sound very sweet . is it her brand ?"
"She is! It was a watch that I had been wanting for a long time. I have used the same G-Shock watch for 6 years (which I love), but I wanted the upgraded version.	whoa that ' s awesome . congratulations , did she give you a ride to your birthday ?"
"I just graduated from college! I feel so accomplished.	that ' s awesome ! what college ? im super happy for you"
"I am very excited about it! Although I am a bit nervous about what is to come. I still need to find a job.	what a great accomplishment , i hope you ace that job hunt ."
"I am waiting to receive my final grade for a summer college class that I just finished. I took the final exam yesterday, and I am not sure what score I will receive.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	oh wow , do you think you did well ? or will you be unable to retake it ?"
"I have, too. I actually took two classes this summer. I took an online final exam about an hour ago, and I scored the grade that I was needing. The grade I am concerned about is a Strategic Management course that I also was taking. The professor was a bit of a stickler when it came to grading.	do haven ' t you thought it ' s probably going to be fine ?"
"I recently had intercourse with somebody that I hate. I feel terrible.	oh , no . what happened ? do you know anyone that you hate ?"
"No, I do not think I should. This person doesn't make me happy.	have you been friends with any of his friends ever ? it happens to all of us ."
"My mom got really sick for a long time before she died. I was doing my best to see are as often as I could but I had work and lived 6 hours away.	im really sorry to hear that , i hope you feel better now ! it sucks not being able to see them often ."
"The worst thing happened though. I wasn't able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off	oh man that ' s terrible . why did you have to move away ?"
"I recently went to eat a restaurant that was not very clean. The whole place had an odd odor and made me uncomfortable.	i understand , when i go to a restaurant to eat its always the worst , i bet i will never go back ."
"I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning.	well can ' t you return the favor . you are such a naughty boy . what do you think you will do this year ?"
"I recently returned to my childhood home, and it brought back a flood of wonderful memories. I am feeling quite sentimental.	oh how fun ! i have been there before too , it is so nice to see old memories come back ."
"Yes, it definitely can be an emotional experience. Were/are you close with your grandparents?	yes i am close with them yes . i just had a little surprise meeting them on the spot during the summer but other than that they are not in the picture ."
"I was going through some boxes the other day. I found some old pictures of my kids I thought were gone	that must ' ve been exciting to look through ! did you find any children ' s pictures ?"
"Yes, definitely! It really made us all start talking about those and other memories, good times.	man i know so many memories like that have made me so nostalgic . memories are very nice to have"
"We had to get out of the house because of Hurricane Matthew. It was a scary experience, but luckily we'd already packed what we needed into the car, so could just leave.	wow , that ' s pretty scary . where were you when it happened ?"
"Oh, you poor thing! Thankfully, we'd gassed up and were good to go. The house survived too. Were you ok?	i was okay . it was a little bit dangerous though . my family went through a complete guess as to how we would ' ve gotten there . we put things back together eventually"
"Ugh. We had to take the walls back to the studs, it was so bad inside. But thankfully we have wonderful friends, who accommodated us and helped with the clean-up!	I recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous.	oh no ! is it for a future surgery ? how was it went ?"
"It started off as a checkup, but then they requested additional testing.	are you ok ? was it fine ? how did the results go ?"
"My neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! I couldn't believe how fast they completed the project!	what are they doing now ? did they finish ? how long is they working on it ?"
"Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse?	i have never built one ! but i ' ve heard of it but never to disclose myself !"
"I recently had to attend a funeral. That's never a fun day.	oh no , do you think you ' ll be ok ?"
"Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother.	awww that is such a sad loss . . . . i am sorry . i have always wanted to go through something like that ."
"I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me	what was the person doing there ? were they just sitting there watching you ?"
"I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing	that sounds very frustrating ! i hate waiting for medical supplies . i feel like a chicken there . they say the patient should be by themselves , if they want to do the patient ."
"Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!	that is so annoying . hopefully he learned his lesson and isn ' t a jerk now ."
"I am waiting to take a big test coming up! I feel prepared, yet I am anxious.	oh no ! hopefully you will know what you ' re ready for ?"
"Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking.	good luck for you . you are confident and excited , but your hard work will pay off . you sound prepared !"
"I am taking a vacation to Orange Beach, Alabama in a week! My wife and I visited the area about two years ago, and we loved it!	that ' s so sweet , orange beach is really fun to visit !"
"We can't wait! Have you ever been to the ocean?	no i haven ' t ! is it really that awesome ?"
"One time my husband surprised me on our anniversary with a really pretty necklace and a trip to a Bed and Breakfast!	oh wow , that ' s adorable ! were you happy ?"
"We have been married for 14 years.  Another reason it was so surprising was b/c he usually just takes me to dinner!	oh my god . 14 years ! well congratulations to you guys ! so you guys have been together so long and enjoy it ! you ' re definitely gonna have to keep it going for the next few years ."
"It was one of those keys to your heart type.  Do you know what I mean?	i understand . i would never take someone you are married to dinner ! good on you ."
"Yes the ones from Kay Jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top	oooooh ! so how long have you been reading and working on a loan ?"
"I went to the store for sodas and it ended up being a rough trip.	oh no , i ' m sorry to hear that ! what happened ?"
"I dropped my money while my hands were full, ran into the door, and the bag busted sending a 2 liter bouncing through the parking lot. And of course there were a lot of people that saw.	oh man , that is terrifying ! and also so true ! how did the rest of your trip end up ?"
"I suspect that my husband is fixing a lot to go to a party, I suspect he is going to see someone	what if he makes how ? does he know when it will be for the event ?"
"I'm going to take some time and I'll be looking at it with caution	wow , what an exciting event ! i hope you have a fun and happy weekend !"
"sure ... thanks	My sister is always the sibling that my parents talk about. Sometimes I wonder if they even notice me.	that ' s funny , my sister does the same thing . . . how old does your family feel about it ?"
"I haven't. I'm scared that it would just make the situation worse. Do you think I should tell them how I feel?	i think you should definitely tell them that you feel scared and maybe they will be surprised . it is different and you should focus on you"
"My boss finally realized all the hard work I've been doing lately.	okay , tell me about it . tell me about it ."
"Things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately, but mine finally came through at a good time!	that ' s great ! everyone seems to be lacking in that department lately . i hope things continue to get better ."
"Thanks. And it's the weekend. Perfect timing.	I was on an airplane last week, and someone's baby would not stop crying. I know it isn't right to be upset about such things, but it really bothered me.	oh man ! that is a big one . did you call the baby to close his eyes ?"
"I tried to think about that, but I was still aggravated. On the plus side, at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational.	oh yeah that ' s really upsetting . do you know where the baby was ?"
"I was given a job offer at a new company. I decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty.	that ' s cool . loyalty is very important in job interviews ."
"Yes, I think so as well. The new company offered me approximately $10,000 more a year than my current business is paying though.	congratulations , that is a great pay raise . it ' s probably for the best ."
"My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady.	what is giving to a fairy ? ! what has she sent you ?"
"I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card, but she is living on a fixed income.	thats pretty awesome . i wish you and your family all the best ."
"A tornado blew through my town last week. My family hid in our storm shelter, but I wasn't sure if we were going to survive it unscathed.	wow , i am glad you are safe . where did you live ?"
"Thank you! We were rather frightened, and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended.	i live in florida and had an evacuate who blamed the hurricane on our house . i am glad you were well prepared ."
"Hello the plants in my garden I water them, I move the earth, I try to keep them happy	that ' s a very brave way to do it . i love it when others can participate in your garden ."
"Especially when you feel something special by nature	you sound like a great friend , encourage them to do good things . how many do you have ?"
"I hope this feeling increases	My wife has a big birthday coming up and I've got a great weekend all laid out for her.	that awesome ! what is your favorite part of this weekend ?"
"We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years.	you ' re so excited ! ! ! what are you planning to cook ?"
"Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows, but I can't really tell for sure.	ok . . well good for you . i hope you have fun"
"Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!	oh man , that was really unexpected ! what was the ending to it ?"
"Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.	dang , did you tell him you had a headache first ? or is it over your head ?"
"Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.	oh man that is absolutely horrifying . what did you do ?"
"Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'	wow , that is quite an awkward first word , how long did the last stand last ?"
"I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom, ever!	that must have been a surprise haha . i love when that happens !"
"I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!	i am sorry about that . do you think you will be shaggy not rust>"
"I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding!	i understand , stealing is bad but why would you steal it ? it is an awesome gift to your kids ."
"Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?	where i think you can decide which one to keep . there are plenty of other options ."
"it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.	that would be very annoying ! why does she have to do that ?"
"Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.	i understand . i have a problem with that . i feel so lonely and like i ' m not enough of a man when it comes to finding a new restaurant ."
"I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic.	where good for you buddy . how did you have your weekend go ?"
"it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup.	i bet it was a good catchup ! how long has it been since you have seen each other ?"
"I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.	congratulations ! are you a teacher , student or a nurse ?"
"Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!	wow , that ' s amazing ! i guess these days i just need to learn more . i just like to study and be prepared but i ' m not very smart ."
"Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been.	it ' s good to hear that . is it your own fault for suddenly deciding to make the decision to purchase a house - or perhaps you just don ' t trust yourself enough ?"
"Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!	good for you . i ' m hoping for the same thing ."
"My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness	i thank god for you . please give me that money ."
"I wish they did not suffer, because it is my suffering	what about my friends help me when necessary ? do they scold me because i am not prepared for anything ?"
"Thanks for your comprehension	Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window.	oh , i bet that must have been horrible ! sounds awful ."
"By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.	wow , that ' s a vivid description of what it is like . i bet you guys were happy to stay put until it passed !"
"I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.	my friend , that ' s very unfortunate . well , i hope you feel better ."
"No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed	i ' m really sorry to hear that , it must be very hard to be in such a predicament . i hope you have an alternative alternative means of getting out ."
"no it is an autoimmune disease	Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken	aww . i am sorry . how sad that you are going through ."

"I've had so many flats in my life I've gotten quick at changing them.	are you a flat free person ? i have not had that experience . i can use flat screen onic but i need my floor jack and 4way lug lug"
"One time, my friends were daring me to jump into a very cold spring from a height of around 40 feet. I was nervous, naturally.	oh my gosh ! lol . . . . that ' s terrifying ! what was your reaction if you fell ?"
"Yeah, I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed.	oh my gosh ! you must have been very brave ! i guess i should have done it sooner !"
"My dear friend Kris just started a job at a gorgeous golf resort on the shores of Lake Michigan. The green-eyed monster in me wants sooo badly to be there!	wait , are you seriously serious ? why do you think there are such monsters ?"

"I'm trying. Thank you for making me feel better - I really do wish him great success and happiness.	I'm so excited about an upcoming move and life change -- it's a move to a verrrry different state, but should be interesting!	what is the new thing that you ' re excited about ?"

"Yes, I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.	haha , i bet it was fun at the time when you all figured it out . did you enjoy it ?"
"I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.	oh no ! that ' s never a good feeling ! i hope you called what happened next for him ?"
"Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.	i feel that way sometimes as well sometimes . sometimes it ' s hard to agree on what to do on the first day of a project . it ' s so important to get on the horse when you lose your best friend ."
"I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.	oh , that must have been a nerveycopline for sure"

"I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer, despite being busy with other customers, took the time to take my purchases to my car. What a wonderful, kind man!	that must have been very annoying ! i ' m sorry to hear that . do you have lots of pets ?"

"Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck	oh no ! did it sting you more than wasp did ? !"
"Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!	So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700.	how did you do that ? did you get the package back ?"
"Luckily, they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.	you know they tried to give you something , you just wanted to give it back ?"
"I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days, when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.	good old days indeed , such freedom for everyone ! good old days ."
"Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha	that is so funny , that you think about that . maybe it ' s time to start saving your own money now ? : )"

"I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed, frankly.	hahaha , well , two hours is a long time to wait , gotta give it to him ."
"I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship!	what was your friend ' s name ? sounds pretty interesting ."
"Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.	well maybe you could see if there is anything in the least . and if there isn ' t , then maybe you can work it out somehow ."
"Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while, that's for sure!	I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.	ohh how awesome ! how do you feel about that ? i ' ve never won anything . . . ever"
"She won $5,000 and never offered to share.	that is kinda disappointing , but i guess you never know what she will come up with !"
"I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.	violin , how did you do ? i have never heard of anyone taking any marked future mark exam exams - how long have you been studying for it ?"

"I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.	i hope it ' s not too far from where you live ! what does sword the mine look like ?"

"I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am, I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me!	oh my god ! what did you do ? did you thank them ?"
"Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.	oh my gosh , that is crazy . it sounds like something i would have seen happen to me as a kid . how have you managed to sleep ?"
"Well, that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said ""Good morning. Can't sleep either?"" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!	My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.	you oh no , i am so sorry to hear that . has she been trying to make friends and how far away she is from home ?"
"Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away.

"Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad!	yeah , i have had that happen too . i hate it ."
"Exactly, I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving, which makes things even less safe	indeed . some drivers are just not responsible for the safety of others ."

"I was really frightened the other night. I was home alone and there was a big storm.	oh , i can imagine . was it a strong storm ?"
"Fortunately, it didn't, but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!	storms can be scary . i have had some in my past life that scared me too , so i understand how you feel . but i ' m glad that you ' re okay and the people helping you are keeping safe !"
"I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.	yeah i didnt know that was he that long ago . i remember that moment very well"
"Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.	i know . . i felt the exact same when he passed away . i am glad that he lived a good life ."
"It is. I read his book Kitchen Confidential. He's been battling addiction and demons all his life. I thought he'd found peace, but I guess not.	My work supervisor came into my store recently.

"Not even a little.	that ' s gross , what did you do ? did you tell him he lost it ?"
"I can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me. I am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight.	i don ' t understand what you say ? did something happen ?"

"I felt very isolated when we first moved to Hong Kong -- I had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!	i ' m sorry you felt that way . was it because of school or something else ?"
"It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!	i can imagine how you feel , that ' s very neat though . did you end up staying in the country long enough to start selling your home ?"
"Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!	how that sounds great . i ' m more of an envious person who grew up in expat culture . would you say the same for yourself ?"

"sorry that was sent by an mistake	you must have been very proud of that person . what a tragedy to become who you are . hopefully he is still in the navy ."
"I don't think I am a judgmental person, but we all have our limits. I stayed on my girlfriend's friend's homestead for a day, and I can still smell it.	hey i don ' t think you ' re a judgmental person , you just sound like you have a filter on your hands . not that you ' re judgmental , just curious . why do you feel that way ?"

"And then the stores get so crowded after a certain point!	how that is always disappointing ! why don ' t you just go into the stores early ?"
"I think next year I'm going to start early but just do everything online.  All the stores in town were absolute messes today!	I was having a bad day the other day and everything just kept going wrong	how did that go ? are you still a dummy or what"

The worst part was, usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no, not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!	oh wow , i ' m sorry , i hope you didn ' t have to much trouble with the list ! you won though ! good job ! what were you paying for ?"
"I have to grocery shop on Thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down.  But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year, I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!	oh , that sounds stressful ! glad you made it to the checkout line ! i bet the kids that prepared for school today didn ' t start today ! now , you ' ve got me curious . . . why did the school start tomorrow ? and what happened to the money you had ?"
"Especially since I was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!	what are you going to buy oh my gosh ! that is so annoying !"
"The other day I was getting a glass out the cabinet and There sat a spider	did it bring you any sentimental value ? did you give it to him ?"
"I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that!	oh gosh that sounds so scary . you might have to call what now"
"It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater, but this ""play"" I went to recently was a little too much.	i ' m really not good with the spelled terms , and i ' m not a very good player either . how was it ?"

"Not all of my high-school memories are fond ones. Like the time I drank too much and passed out at a party.	oh yeah i understand that feeling . it wasn ' t a good one"
"I was about 16 at the time. The thing is, I passed out right in front of the entrance to the house. Everyone coming and going had to step over me!	oh no ! haha i am so sorry to hear that ! that must have been a long time ago ! i bet that was a good party . i didn ' t go to a party for a long time either ! but i hope you had fun . : )"

"I still live and work in the place where I grew up, but all of my friends have moved away.	why , are you unable to hang out with them ? do you miss them ?"

I enjoy reliving the memories, things were often simpler and more carefree back then.	i remember the feeling of reliving the first time i heard a song from my childhood . my mom always wished i could tell you every little note , picture , and memorizing to her sounds so nice and light ."
"So I consider myself a decent bowler but my brother came out of nowhere, he's actually really skilled. I'm kind of shocked actually.	how long o interesting . have you watched any youtube videos on it ?"

"I don't think so actually, I haven't let him know that I love that type in particular so much haha. I am definitely wishing it was mine though!	nice . . you should buy him a gift when he knows you love it so he can keep the car for when he gets a bit more ."
"So I want to buy a new vehicle but I'm nervous about pulling the trigger on it.	just keep your pros and cons to a short list . i know it sounds like you are really confident in yourself . . . i hope you do well ."
"Yep. Like, my current car is dying, but I almost literally want to drive it until it no longer runs at all.	oh no ! well , if you don ' t have the cash , buy a used car !"
"PEople are crazy now a days. I watched people try to take a gas can from my yard!	oh my lord , are they that crazy ? i could never do that ! what did you do ?"

"I had to dogsit for my dad about a week ago. I had to clean up dog poop at least 10 times, it was awful.	oh my god , are you ok ? that sounds gross . do you feel bad ?"
"Oh yes. I wish I could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them, but I would be lying.	oh gosh ! that ' s actually not fun . i have no dogs and i know this would make me so mad . poor thing !"
"So I was listening to rap in my car with the windows down. The people in the car next to me were just staring at me. It was kinda awkward.	hahaha , maybe they thought you were playing some super loud , greasy , two peaching rap ?"
"Yeah, not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.	lol . you have been pretty embarrassed over it . i would of been a little embarrassed myself . well anyways . . . . do you have any more reccomendations for me ?"
"I was really worried about how I'd afford textbooks this semester.	can you visit them again ? what happened ? did you eventually get your hands on the books ?"

"Last winter I was out on my porch at 4 am. Suddenly a large figure dressed in black was walking towards me. My heart was beating like a drum!	did he make you feel guilty or do you think he was doing it on purpose ?"
"I wasn't sure at first and, being in a wheelchair, had nowhere to go. Then the dark figure stopped in front of me. I thought I'd had it. Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn't sleep, walking her dog!	oh my goodness , i am so happy for you . what did you do ?"

"I am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can't wait. It'll be quiet as it looks onto a forest!	what is the new name of the place ? do you like it ?"
"Not with traffic, but with the people upstairs - they're a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there, so fingers crossed!	that sounds really awesome ! congratulations ! that sounds wonderful ! i wish you the best of luck with your new place ! what are you originally originally from ?"

"That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.	true . and that ' s true that some schools make different choices , and that ' s true in other places too . but i ' m sure that ' s a good thing for the overall safety of the children ."
"That's true - when I was in kindergarten, we only went for half the day.	When I lived in California my farmer friend and landlord had me get organized and have all my valuables together in case of a big earthquake. He stockpiled such things as batteries and water.	was there any damage to the house ? i have a hard time preparing ."

I'm so full of admiration for her - instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy-depressed, she pulled herself together and made a new, exciting life her new reality.	i am sure it was nice to see that a new life is filled with exciting life experiences , and hopefully the memories will spill over into the next one . i hope she feels better soon ."
"Yes, she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there, she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!	that is a very exciting and scary situation you are sharing your good life with her . i hope she feels better soon !"

"For some reason I've been thinking of our family Christmases back when I was a kid. I so enjoyed decorating the tree, helping my Mom with preparing lunch. And of course, eating Christmas lunch! Fun times.	i love that idea of begging the parent to deliver the package for you , i hope they come around !"

"i know, i got some motrin, funny movies and lots of cuddles.i hope he will feel better tomorrow	that is a hard situation . i know how that can be , hopefully he will feel better ."
"i used to be a member of a cool dance crew. we had so much fun together. we used to battle other teams and win local competitions	that ' s pretty cool . i still do some work at that gym too !"
"honestly, no, it's been 8 years haha loooong time ago! I wish i could hang out with all those people again	i know how you feel . 8 years is a long time . there are lots of great memories ! what did you do on the dance team ?"
"I'm getting really psyched about the upcoming Ryder Cup golf tournament. I've been watching it since I was a kid.	oh i bet that will be fun ! do you play golf ?"
"I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that, if you don't play, it would be pretty boring!	oh , i ' ve been trying to learn and learn golf as a kid . i ' ve never played but have heard good things !"
"I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.	Last Christmas Eve, after a family event, I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room. At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him, and it had hurt her feelings.	i ' m so sorry to hear that . i hope she learns from this and can be more respectful towards the other student ."
"Yes, I was able to make her feel better, and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out, and I was ready to confront some people.	congratulations ! you have made my day ! that ' s a difficult time for everyone in this world . but i am sure you have had a hand in it !"
"Yes, they did.	I was cleaning up my garden bed when I found a bunch of bones in it!	did you guess what they were ? i ' m sure you ' ll get back to hearing about it someday !"
"I called the cops! Turns out that it's bird bones! My cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden!	thats unfortunate ! are you going to get rid of the cat ?"
"I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals!	me too . it is truly horrendous ! it truly breaks my heart when you hear stories like that ."
"They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!	its sad that so many people do it and its hard to stop them ."
"More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.	Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I.	what did you say ? that sound scary . what was it ?"
"It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in.	wow ! i would ' ve thought it was something dead . i ' ve heard raccoon rummaging around in the trash before . that must have been really scary ."
"It would be, I worry for the safety of my family.	My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.	that ' s a very noble do consider to hope for . is there anything else in particular you think he will need ?"
"They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.	will you repay him now ? yes - i believe he will . or have you set up a deal now ?"
"Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.	My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first	oh my gosh , that ' s terrifying ! do you think you were okay ?"
"He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too!	wow , that is really scary ! i don ' t think i would have been comfortable alone in such a room . it ' s usually so dangerous !"
"Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.	oh my lord ! i have not seen a fly but know what you mean . i ' m sure if i saw one right now it would make me feel terrible"
"Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?	oh yes ! i hate when i see those fly ! do they hang out in the daytime too ?"
"i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes	she is lucky to have your support . it is good to be by your side ."
"like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat	is she your friend a guy ? a guy ? i ' m pretty sure she ' s a cool guy if that ' s what you ' re talking about !"
"It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.	im sorry to hear that . what happened ? will you be able to talk about it ?"
"Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.	oh man , i really hope you did a good job of searching for your lost friend . i ' m sure he was a great guy ."
"A border collie, he was a great doggie.	My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.	oh i am sorry , was he ok ? did everything turn out okay ?"
"She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.	that sounds scary , hopefully they got the xray turned out okay !"
"I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.	well , hopefully , that doesn ' t happen again ! stay safe , buddy !"
"I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay, but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.	oh my gosh ! i hope the flood unburden you and your family hard . but this isn ' t what happened , it ' s a miracle !"
"I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.	you must be so excited about something . how much is a kit for your car ?"
"I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.	did you just hand yourself a car ? haha ? i packed a kit myself , but my dad kept it for special occasions . i ' m always ready to start a new life"
"I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!	I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.	wow - i bet you will do well . what did you study ?"
"Thank you, I have been compiling  data for 5 years, my brain is totally absorbed by it.	you should be quite proud of yourself . what is your degree in ?"
"Criminal and social justice.	I just froze when It was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world.	ah yes that can be nerve racking ! ! i hate when that happens ! i have also been in that position before . . . sdid you have fun ?"
"I think it was just the thought of being so high up.	i am sure you had a good time . what did you think about it ?"
"I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.	oh , that sounds fun ! you must have a good group of friends ! have you all been looking to sign up for lessons at a4 or 5$ ?"
"Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.	why are you not ready to go out with all your friends ?"
"In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.	absolutely absolutely . their i agree with you . it ' s sad , i lost a pregnant dog once . it was such a sad loss ."
"Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.	how long wow . i felt the same , but now i am back to not having any pets . i guess its good to have our pets"
"Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.	A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.	oh , how cool ! how ' s the cruise going so far ?"
"Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!	what where oh my goodness ! that must ' ve been a total blast , how could you not die ?"
"When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped.	that is so sad . how is she holding that ? i can ' t even imagine not going to school and not be able to pay bills"
"She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade	she sounds like a smart student but i ' m sure she needs a lot more than just a doctor ! does she have anyone at school that can help her ?"
"I finally had a day of, but the weather was terrible and rainy and cold.	o really , that is a shame , im sure you will make it up for it one day ."
"I was hoping to get a chance to play outside and get some sun.	oh , the weather was cold and rainy ? i hate the cold , i bet you were so overprepared . you should have taken the time to make a plan for yourself ."
"I just got back from a latenight showing of the horror movie insidious	oooh , i do like those shows . what was it ?"
"Not really I  almost had an accident at some of the startling points.	did you go with your friends ? where did you go for the blind showing ?"
"I have been looking around at different car insurance quotes	oh , have you found anything so far ? maybe you can find one that is completely different wao money ?"
"a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is	yes . gotta pay for the local insurance companies . the prices there are outrageous ."
"I just ate a whole cake by myself, I feel sick!	you must feel really hungry . i would not worry about it"
"Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house.	i what exactly is your diet ? do you have any diet sucess books on it ?"
"The other night I had a panic attack out the blue	are you ok ? what happened ? what did you do ?"
"Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about.	oh no , i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you ' re ok . maybe you can go and get a routine check up soon ."
"I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.	did you buy a lock on it ? or did you have to go to the woods and get it ?"
"We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.	i what how amazing and lucky you ! i would be pretty upset to lose a pet ! what is it ?"
"We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there.	I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing.	im sorry about that , that really sucks . i know how it feels . just try not to give up on the good old days ."
"That's just it. We didn't really ""break up"" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.	that does sound rough . i ' m sorry to hear that ."
"Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight.	im sorry you ' re amazing for showing that kind of devotion to someone ."
"I will, you never know when someone else is in need!	that is so nice of you , i bet that was a nice experience for everyone involved !"
"It is, I have been so blessed in my life!	My husband started college this week!	that ' s cool . what does he teach ? what are you two going to school for ?"

"So gross, that is certain.	I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air	oh no ! what happened after you tripped ? did you have a flashback of when you fell ?"
"I thankfully didn't burn myself bad but I spilled it all over myself! I was so shy afterwards	you know you can just start looking forward to it and keep doing better . im sure you will get over it"
"Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid, I was really frightened the other night.	what movie did you go watch ? scared ? ? ? ?"
"I went for a drink downstairs, and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night,lol.	oh wow , what happened next ? did you get a cab ?"
"I really was, and I'm supposed to be the grown up, but I got my daughter to lie next to me.	My neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep!	oh no , that ' s horrible . have you tried calling the police or something ?"
"People walking on the bike trail behind our house. It's a daily thing, it gets so annoying!	i would start oh well , you should complain to the police or complain to them but no"
"I just got done eating an entire pizza by myself.	that sounds really good ! what kind of pizza did you have ?"
"I feel so full and fat and happy. I can't wait to do it again.	hey you must be really proud of yourself ! good for you !"
"When I got my first paycheck with a bonus, I knew I didn't need to worry anymore about my expenses. It was quite the feeling!	money is always a scary thing . . . but a bonus is a good feeling"

"It really is, you are molding their future!	I just lost my dog. My ex got him in the divorce	aww , i am sorry to hear that . have you found him ?"
"No we are not on speaking terms, It's pretty unfair, thankfully we didn't have a kid together.	that is really really tough . im so sorry you are having to go through that ."
"Getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle.	oh yeah it ' s definitely frustrating ! what kind of debit card do you use ?"
"They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.	oh no . i hope that you can have an online contact with your bank to contact them"
"It is, to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.	My sister got a promotion at work last week!	how did she get it ? is it a good one ?"
"She is an accountant for a college in Alaska. She's been working their for years so I'm glad they saw her dedication :)	awww thats awesome ! how has she been working there ?"
"My friend wrote a creative writing piece that I helped edit, and it won her a scholarship. I was so proud, like a dad, even though we're roughly the same age.	oh , what a commendable event . you do a great job . i am so happy for you ."
"Yeah it was! I joke with her that I should get a portion of the money since I told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it. She wasn't originally going to.	that ' s so amazing . what a great story ! i ' m sure you must be so proud and proud . i went to school for something called creative writing and it was pretty important for me . i was blown away ."
"My eldest son is off and is starting his first year in college.  Im so nervous for him!	are you spill yourself full of myself or are you him excited to start ? i assume you ' re a proud k educated child ?"
"I think it's more stressful for me than it is for him!  I just want the best for him, just not used to not being there with him.	hey its and m series , is it his first full name ?"
"Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?	good luck , i ' m sure he ' ll be fine !"
"Cant wait to see what he can do,  Its exciting too!	yes , that is absolutely right . when your son grows up you will have to keep the freak in him and he will forget what he is doing ."
"I have trouble remembering a time I was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when I got the Nintendo 64 for Christmas all those years ago.	what was the time limit on the 64 ? i was always too young to play ."
"It sure is now, but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.	i remember that feeling too , a long long , busy day of waiting ! you have to remember that day with any kid nowadays . they are pretty easy to spend hours on it , right ?"

"Haha my husband plays video games as well, but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.	oh man that ' s a tough situation , that ' s why we don ' t have kids . my husband and i have kids and i struggle so much with being stuck in bed . i wish we could be able lumber on video games as well , lol ."
"Let me tell you something. Always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters. Few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!	oh lord . how did you miss that ? hahaha"
"Not only did I have a rough morning because of it, but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.	you know what they say , never be a nerd out loud , use capital words , you will bomb it ."
"4	have you ever said that to someone out there before ? i hope you have something to say about it ."
"Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon, they carry something in their nails/claws.	are they allowed to do that in your work ? i ' ve never actually read any of that before ."
"My son wanted one of those once, but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one,lol.	I got canned from my job and I'm feeling pretty good these days because I have more work than I can handle without needing to go to an office everyday	oh congratulations ! what job are you working at ? i hope you will get to tell me about it ."
"Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts, good thing I'm not allergic	that is good to hear , what do you do for work ?"

"No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it, my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!	oh man , i ' ve been in that situation that situation and i ' ve learned to stop . don ' t do it again"
"I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.	don ' t feel bad . your roommate probably missed a concept your not proud of . did it come out right ?"
"She probably did, during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am, drunk, with some random guy she brought home from the club.	i ' m very glad you came back happy with that lol"
"Either he ate it, or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it, and I'm about to hulk out!	I am so not ready for this baby. The wife is due next week, and I'm really uncertain that I'm gonna be a good dad or that we'll have enough to provide for her.	why don ' t you just have a baby ? you can always adopt when she comes ."
"I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books, and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.	i don ' t think you have to worry about that unless you already have two kids ! you can have lots of fun , hopefully she will be fine ."

"I'm taking my midterm exam this week, and I really want to do well on it. I've studied a lot, and taken the practice test 5 times. I'm still pretty anxious though!	i know how you feel , it is not easy but just stay confident"
"That's true. I probably have it down pat at this point. It's just it's my first graduate course, and I want to ace my entire graduate degree with a 4.0 GPA. This is my first major major grade.	good luck . i ' m sure you ' ll do great ."
"I was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex-girlfriend didn't get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before I moved. Really made me miss her, seeing all that stuff.	awwww , that ' s sad . it ' s tough when you have no family to keep your stuff ."
"Well, I spent some time remembering the good times. Then I reminded myself that we broke up for a reason, and we'd moved on. Had to process all the way through it, you know?	yeah i ' m sure it ' s hard to cross the finish line when you first get to feel that way . when you first get to where you are you have to try and have the back story to tell yourself ."
"Polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call.	as for sure . i mean its insane how many ways they can get into a accident . some people are just careless"

"I am constantly amazed by my sister's art skills. I'm not sure where she got them...my brother and I can't draw to save our lives.	aww , i am happy you both have such great art friends . i am the same way . i find art very boring"
"Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young, so she has a way to go, but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.	what kind of things do your sister draw ? is she doing on a special vacation or for work ?"
"I used to worry that I would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if I had problems, but my best friend Kayla has proved otherwise.	what did ç? you must be very fond of him if he proved otherwise !"
"I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life, and she's always been supportive.	that is so great to hear . i ' m really happy for you . i ' m so happy you have that close friend support you ."
"I have some bad news, unfortunately. Well, bad for me. I was diagnosed with lung cancer.	oh that ' s no good . that is really horrible news . have you tried smoking ?"
"It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health, and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.	oh no ! that ' s terrible . i ' m so sorry to hear that , it must be hard ."
"Thank you so much for being supportive. :)	I heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night. I think it was 2 or 3 in the morning.	im sorry i am not allowed to watch gun shots in my neighborhood"
"Not a chance! I was too scared to go out, and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.	oh my goodness . i would have been terrified . is you home now ?"
"Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that, no way jose.	I really didn't know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend.	oh no . is he okay ? how is he feeling ?"
"Seems to have, yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year, but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.	ah , i hope the surgery goes well and he feels better . i ' m sure you can find something that will help him most ."
"Yes, hopefully he does, because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely, not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.	I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...	oh wow , that is really horrible ! i am so sorry to hear that ."
"I might look into that, thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore, it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids, is a big one.	oh my god . that is terrible . but now you have some coverage for your kit that might help you . that is a serious medical situation . i ' m so sorry ."

"Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl, and I was stupid enough to believe her.	I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty.

Visited lots of relatives, cooked lots of stuff, goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand, I miss having my kids around to do stuff with.	i hope it turns out better for you , it is good you had fun"
"Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!	its good you had such a fun time . enjoy yourself and stay positive !"

"They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!	i hope they will end up in the mangrove with the rest of their lives ."
"Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.	animal abuse is extremely dangerous . i don ' t think i ' d ever want to do anything like that"
"Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully, those animals can find good care and good homes.	you i agree with you , it ' s sad that people feel that way but i hope that they can bring about a better support group to the rescue as well ! i feel the same way about the government ."
"And in my opinion, the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough - they should have had to stay in jail!	why ? what was wrong with them ? what happened ? how are they being treated ?"
"My son's soccer coach said nice things about his play last year and told me he would do what he could to get him on his team this year as well.	that ' s cool . did he play professionally ? and what do you think he ' ll do on the team ?"

"I went for a walk the other day and one of the neighbors dogs was loose, a bit white husky, he was aggressive.	that is good how did the dog respond ? i am not sure what to do without a dog"

"The little kitten I rescued last Friday passed away.	oh no ! i am so sorry . how are you feeling about it ?"

"And that kitten knew she was loved.  It ended sad, but I take comfort in those things.	My 6 year old tried to play a video game but couldn't understand how the controller worked. A few days later she was playing no problem!	you teaching her some new discipline and maybe even to not seem so chicken ."
"Yea, i was pretty proud of her, especially since things are more complicated now than when i was a kid.	how not funny , i bet that is something they will do good . i remeber the first time my daughter bought a video game , we were about to play street fighter . she just fell right in love with the game and didnt even try for a few days ."
"I thought I had paid all my daughter's band fees only to find out that I'm 10 dollars short.	how do you feel about that ? do you feel bad about that ?"
"I keep all my receipts - I learned that lesson her 9th grade year.  I just hate having to make the trip over to the high school because it's in the opposite direction of where I do everything else!	hm . . i understand . how did you end up doing then ?"
"I went through a divorce last year, which caught me off guard financially, luckily my mom was able to help with some of the costs.	i ' m sorry that ' s hard to hear . it ' s nice to know that your mom can help . how is it holding up now ?"
"Yea i'm much better now, thanks to my mom. Attorneys make a killing on these types of things.	i am happy you are better now . will you write back now ?"
"When my wife left me it was so quiet in the house! it almost drove me crazy	oh no ! what happened ? was she mean to you ?"
"hah, i hear ya. I just got so used to all the commotion i suppose.	i ' m happy you ' re learning to talk properly now , you ' ll feel more confident in the future ."

"It was the new Jurassic World	i did not expect to hear about that movie , but now i am interested ."
"My coworker forgot to turn in the paperwork to switch our on call weeks. He ended up costing me $250! I'm so mad!!!	that is really unfair ! how did he get that much money ?"
"He's such a worm. I can't stand it.	that ' s not a very nice of him , did you speak to him about it ?"
"Working from home can be difficult when people won't leave me alone to get work done.	sorry , i understand that . i ' m sure you will do fine though"

"Yeah, but not what I want to bite into when I am trying to enjoy my apple.	okay , now tell me about it ! how is the taste different ?"
"That is true, I should be thankful for that.	I was hiking in the mountains and walked up on a female bear with her two cubs.	that ' s so cute , how did you react ? did you get to see the bear ?"
"They really startled me, the female did not seem happy to see me.	i ' m not sure what , do you have a pet bear ?"
"Yeah, thankfully I was able to get away. It took a while for me to catch my breath.	I got a new dog recently, he is the best. I am so thankful for him!	i bet he is a good friend . dogs can be so lovely"

"Will do! He is super cuddly and loves to follow me around!	There was one piece of pie left in the fridge. Instead of sharing it, I ate it. I kind of feel bad.	what kind of pie ? what kind of name is it ?"
"It might not be when my wife returns and sees it gone. I look super guilty right now.	oh my goodness . that ' s brutal . . . i would have been thinking the exact same ha ha"

"They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway.

"My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.	i ' m sorry to hear that ! it must be difficult on your own to sell a house . that ' s understandable . it ' s quite common to be in a tough spot"
